# [PERF-001] Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates

## Overview

Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates to provide live container status changes, resource usage updates, and system events without requiring manual refresh or polling.

## Description

Currently, the application relies on periodic polling to update container status and system information. This approach is inefficient and doesn't provide real-time feedback to users. We need to implement WebSocket connections to enable live updates for container state changes, resource usage, and system events.

## Business Value

- **Improved User Experience**: Users see container status changes immediately
- **Reduced Resource Usage**: Eliminates constant polling, reducing CPU and network overhead
- **Better Responsiveness**: Real-time notifications for container events
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Live updates for resource usage and system health

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

- Implement WebSocket connection management
- Create real-time data synchronization
- Add connection state handling (connected, disconnected, reconnecting)
- Implement event listeners for container updates
- Add visual indicators for real-time status

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)

- Implement WebSocket server for real-time communication
- Create event broadcasting system
- Add Docker event monitoring
- Add error handling and reconnection logic

### Data Flow

1. Docker events trigger backend notifications
2. Backend broadcasts events via WebSocket
3. Frontend receives and processes updates
4. UI components update in real-time

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] WebSocket connection established on application startup
- [ ] Container status changes update in real-time
- [ ] Resource usage (CPU, Memory, Network) updates live
- [ ] System events (container start/stop/restart) broadcast immediately
- [ ] Connection state properly managed (connected/disconnected/reconnecting)
- [ ] Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- [ ] Graceful degradation when WebSocket is unavailable

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Connection latency < 100ms for local Docker daemon
- [ ] Memory usage increase < 10MB for WebSocket overhead
- [ ] CPU usage increase < 5% for real-time processing
- [ ] Connection stability maintained during heavy container operations
- [ ] No impact on existing polling-based functionality

### User Experience

- [ ] Visual indicator showing connection status
- [ ] Smooth transitions for status changes
- [ ] No UI freezing during updates
- [ ] Clear feedback when connection is lost
- [ ] Automatic recovery without user intervention

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// WebSocket server setup
// Docker event monitoring
// Event broadcasting system
// Connection management
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// WebSocket connection management
// Real-time data synchronization
// Event listeners and handlers
// UI state management
```

## Dependencies

- Docker Engine API for event monitoring
- WebSocket library for Rust backend
- WebSocket client for React frontend
- Event system for broadcasting updates

## Definition of Done

- [ ] WebSocket connection established and maintained
- [ ] Real-time container status updates working
- [ ] Resource usage live updates implemented
- [ ] Connection state properly managed
- [ ] Error handling and recovery implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Implement a fallback to polling if WebSocket fails
- Monitor memory usage during development
- Test with large numbers of containers
