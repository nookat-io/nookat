# [PERF-007] Implement pagination for large datasets

## Overview

Implement pagination for large datasets to improve performance and user experience when handling thousands of containers, images, networks, and volumes.

## Description

The current implementation loads all data at once, which becomes problematic with large datasets. We need to implement server-side pagination with configurable page sizes, efficient data fetching, and smooth navigation controls to handle large amounts of data without performance degradation.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement pagination controls and navigation
- Add configurable page size options
- Create smooth page transitions and loading states
- Implement search and filtering with pagination
- Add pagination state management and URL synchronization

### Backend

- Implement server-side pagination for all data types
- Add efficient database queries with LIMIT and OFFSET
- Create pagination metadata (total count, page info)
- Implement search and filtering with pagination support
- Add pagination caching and optimization

### Data Flow

1. User requests data with pagination parameters
2. Backend calculates pagination metadata
3. Efficient query fetches only required page of data
4. Frontend receives data with pagination info
5. UI updates with current page and navigation controls
6. Search/filter operations work within pagination context

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Pagination implemented for containers, images, networks, and volumes
- [ ] Configurable page sizes (10, 25, 50, 100 items per page)
- [ ] Search and filtering work with pagination
- [ ] Pagination state persists across navigation
- [ ] URL reflects current page and filters
- [ ] Bulk operations work across multiple pages
- [ ] Pagination controls show current page and total pages

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Page load time < 200ms for any page size
- [ ] Memory usage remains constant regardless of total dataset size
- [ ] Network traffic reduced by 80% for large datasets
- [ ] Pagination metadata calculation < 50ms
- [ ] Smooth page transitions with loading indicators

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive pagination controls and navigation
- [ ] Clear indication of current page and total items
- [ ] Smooth loading states during page transitions
- [ ] Responsive pagination controls
- [ ] Consistent experience across all data types

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Server-side pagination logic
// Efficient query optimization
// Pagination metadata calculation
// Search and filter integration
// Caching for pagination results
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Pagination components
// Page state management
// Navigation controls
// URL synchronization
// Loading states
```

## Dependencies

- Pagination library for React
- URL state management
- Loading state components
- Query optimization framework
- Pagination caching system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Pagination implemented for all data types
- [ ] Configurable page sizes working
- [ ] Search and filtering work with pagination
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] URL state synchronization working
- [ ] Bulk operations work across pages
- [ ] Tests written for pagination functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing infinite scroll as an alternative to pagination
- Monitor user patterns to optimize default page sizes
- Implement smart caching for frequently accessed pages
- Ensure pagination works well with real-time updates
