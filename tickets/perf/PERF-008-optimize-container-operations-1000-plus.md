# [PERF-008] Optimize container operations for 1000+ containers

## Overview

Optimize all container operations to handle 1000+ containers efficiently without performance degradation, ensuring smooth user experience at scale.

## Description

Current container operations become slow and unresponsive when dealing with large numbers of containers. We need to implement batch processing, operation queuing, and performance optimizations to ensure all container operations (start, stop, restart, delete, etc.) work efficiently with 1000+ containers.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement batch operation management for large datasets
- Add progress tracking for bulk operations
- Create operation queuing and prioritization
- Implement operation cancellation and rollback
- Add performance monitoring for large operations

### Backend

- Implement batch processing for container operations
- Add operation queuing and worker threads
- Create efficient bulk operation algorithms
- Implement operation progress tracking and reporting
- Add error handling and recovery for failed operations

### Data Flow

1. User selects multiple containers for operation
2. Operation is queued with priority and batch size
3. Worker threads process operations in batches
4. Progress updates are sent to frontend
5. Failed operations are handled gracefully
6. Operation completion is reported to user

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Bulk start/stop operations work for 1000+ containers
- [ ] Bulk delete operations complete within reasonable time
- [ ] Operation progress is tracked and displayed
- [ ] Failed operations can be retried individually
- [ ] Operation cancellation works for running batches
- [ ] Bulk operations don't block UI
- [ ] Operation history is maintained

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Bulk operations complete within 2 minutes for 1000 containers
- [ ] UI remains responsive during bulk operations
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during large operations
- [ ] Operation progress updates every 100ms
- [ ] Failed operation rate < 5% for bulk operations

### User Experience

- [ ] Clear progress indicators for bulk operations
- [ ] Ability to cancel running operations
- [ ] Detailed feedback for operation results
- [ ] No UI freezing during large operations
- [ ] Intuitive bulk selection and operation interface

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Batch operation processing
// Operation queuing system
// Worker thread management
// Progress tracking
// Error handling and recovery
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Batch operation management
// Progress tracking components
// Operation queuing interface
// Cancellation controls
// Performance monitoring
```

## Dependencies

- Worker thread library for Rust
- Batch processing framework
- Progress tracking system
- Operation queuing library
- Performance monitoring tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Bulk operations work efficiently for 1000+ containers
- [ ] Progress tracking implemented for all bulk operations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (2 minutes for 1000 containers)
- [ ] Operation cancellation and retry working
- [ ] UI remains responsive during large operations
- [ ] Error handling and recovery implemented
- [ ] Tests written for large-scale operations
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Monitor operation patterns to optimize batch sizes
- Implement smart batching based on operation type
- Consider implementing operation scheduling for maintenance windows
- Ensure bulk operations don't interfere with real-time updates
