# [PERF-004] Add background processing capabilities

## Overview

Implement background processing capabilities to handle resource-intensive operations without blocking the user interface, improving overall application responsiveness.

## Description

Currently, heavy operations like bulk container operations, image pruning, and system maintenance tasks block the UI thread. We need to implement background processing using worker threads and async operations to keep the interface responsive while performing intensive tasks.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement background task queue management
- Add progress indicators for background operations
- Create task status monitoring and notifications
- Implement task cancellation capabilities
- Add background task history and logging

### Backend

- Implement worker thread pool for background processing
- Create async task management system
- Add task prioritization and scheduling
- Implement task progress tracking and reporting
- Add task error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Data Flow

1. User initiates heavy operation (bulk delete, prune, etc.)
2. Task is queued in background processing system
3. Worker thread executes task asynchronously
4. Progress updates are sent to frontend
5. UI remains responsive during operation
6. Completion notification is sent to user

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Bulk container operations run in background
- [ ] Image pruning operations don't block UI
- [ ] System maintenance tasks run asynchronously
- [ ] Progress indicators show real-time updates
- [ ] Users can cancel running background tasks
- [ ] Task history and logs are maintained
- [ ] Failed tasks can be retried

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] UI remains responsive during background operations
- [ ] Background tasks don't exceed 80% CPU usage
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during background processing
- [ ] Task queue handles up to 10 concurrent operations
- [ ] Background operations complete within reasonable time limits

### User Experience

- [ ] No UI freezing during heavy operations
- [ ] Clear progress indicators for all background tasks
- [ ] Ability to continue using app while tasks run
- [ ] Notifications for task completion/failure
- [ ] Easy access to task history and status

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Worker thread pool
// Async task management
// Progress tracking system
// Task queue management
// Error handling and recovery
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Background task queue
// Progress indicators
// Task status monitoring
// Cancellation controls
// Task history management
```

## Dependencies

- Worker thread library for Rust
- Async task management framework
- Progress tracking system
- Notification system
- Task queue management library

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Background processing system implemented
- [ ] All heavy operations run asynchronously
- [ ] Progress indicators work for all background tasks
- [ ] Task cancellation and retry functionality working
- [ ] UI remains responsive during background operations
- [ ] Task history and logging implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Tests written for background processing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Monitor CPU and memory usage during background operations
- Implement task prioritization based on user importance
- Consider implementing task scheduling for maintenance operations
- Ensure background tasks don't interfere with real-time updates
