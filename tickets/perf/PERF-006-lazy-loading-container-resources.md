# [PERF-006] Add lazy loading for container resources

## Overview

Implement lazy loading for container resources to improve initial load times and reduce memory usage by loading data only when needed.

## Description

Currently, all container details, logs, and resource information are loaded upfront, causing slow initial load times and high memory usage. We need to implement lazy loading to fetch container resources (logs, file system, resource stats) only when the user requests them, improving performance and user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement lazy loading for container logs
- Add on-demand loading for container file system
- Create lazy loading for resource usage statistics
- Implement loading states and placeholders
- Add prefetching for likely-to-be-accessed data

### Backend

- Create on-demand resource fetching endpoints
- Implement streaming for large log files
- Add resource request queuing and prioritization
- Create resource caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement resource cleanup for unused data

### Data Flow

1. User clicks on container to view details
2. Basic container info loads immediately
3. Detailed resources (logs, stats) load on demand
4. Loading states show progress to user
5. Resources are cached after first load
6. Unused resources are cleaned up automatically

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Container logs load only when user requests them
- [ ] File system browser loads on demand
- [ ] Resource statistics load when container details are opened
- [ ] Loading states show progress for all lazy-loaded content
- [ ] Prefetching works for likely-to-be-accessed data
- [ ] Resource cleanup occurs for unused data
- [ ] Caching works for frequently accessed resources

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Initial container list load time < 1 second
- [ ] Lazy-loaded resources load within 500ms
- [ ] Memory usage reduction of 40% compared to eager loading
- [ ] Network traffic reduction of 50% for initial load
- [ ] Resource cleanup occurs within 5 minutes of last access

### User Experience

- [ ] Fast initial load times for container lists
- [ ] Clear loading indicators for lazy-loaded content
- [ ] Smooth transitions when loading resources
- [ ] No UI blocking during resource loading
- [ ] Intuitive indication of what data is available vs loaded

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// On-demand resource endpoints
// Streaming log delivery
// Resource caching system
// Cleanup mechanisms
// Request prioritization
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Lazy loading components
// Loading states and placeholders
// Resource prefetching
// Cache management
// Cleanup scheduling
```

## Dependencies

- Streaming library for log delivery
- Caching framework for resources
- Loading state management library
- Prefetching strategy implementation
- Resource cleanup system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Lazy loading implemented for all container resources
- [ ] Loading states and placeholders working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (40% memory reduction)
- [ ] Resource cleanup working automatically
- [ ] Prefetching implemented for common scenarios
- [ ] Caching works for frequently accessed resources
- [ ] Tests written for lazy loading functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Monitor user patterns to optimize prefetching strategies
- Implement progressive loading for very large log files
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large resource lists
- Ensure lazy loading doesn't interfere with real-time updates
