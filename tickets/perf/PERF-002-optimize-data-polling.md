# [PERF-002] Optimize data polling for efficient resource usage

## Overview

Optimize the current data polling mechanism to reduce resource consumption while maintaining responsive updates for container status, resource usage, and system information.

## Description

The current polling implementation uses fixed intervals for all data types, leading to unnecessary resource consumption. We need to implement intelligent polling that adapts based on data change frequency, user activity, and system load. This will reduce CPU usage, network overhead, and battery drain while maintaining a responsive user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement adaptive polling intervals based on data type
- Add user activity detection to adjust polling frequency
- Create polling state management (active, paused, adaptive)
- Implement background/foreground polling behavior
- Add polling performance monitoring

### Backend

- Optimize Docker API calls to reduce response time
- Implement data caching to minimize redundant requests
- Add intelligent polling scheduling based on data volatility
- Create resource usage monitoring for polling overhead
- Implement polling throttling during high system load

### Data Flow

1. Frontend determines optimal polling intervals based on user activity
2. Backend receives polling requests and checks cached data
3. Docker API calls are made only when necessary
4. Cached data is returned when available and fresh
5. Polling frequency adjusts based on data change patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Adaptive polling intervals for different data types (containers, images, networks, volumes)
- [ ] Polling pauses when application is in background
- [ ] Polling resumes when user becomes active
- [ ] Data caching reduces redundant API calls by 70%
- [ ] Polling frequency adjusts based on data change frequency
- [ ] Graceful degradation when system resources are limited

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CPU usage reduction of 40% compared to current polling
- [ ] Network traffic reduction of 50% for Docker API calls
- [ ] Battery usage improvement of 30% on mobile devices
- [ ] Response time maintained within 200ms for user interactions
- [ ] Memory usage increase < 5MB for caching system

### User Experience

- [ ] No noticeable delay in data updates during active use
- [ ] Smooth transitions when switching between data types
- [ ] Clear indication when data is being refreshed
- [ ] No UI freezing during polling operations
- [ ] Consistent experience across different system loads

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Intelligent polling scheduler
// Data caching system
// Resource monitoring
// API call optimization
// Throttling mechanism
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Adaptive polling intervals
// User activity detection
// Polling state management
// Performance monitoring
// Background/foreground handling
```

## Dependencies

- Docker Engine API for optimized calls
- Caching library for data storage
- Performance monitoring tools
- User activity detection system
- Resource monitoring framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Adaptive polling implemented for all data types
- [ ] Data caching system reduces API calls by 70%
- [ ] CPU usage reduced by 40% compared to current implementation
- [ ] Background/foreground polling behavior working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] User experience remains responsive
- [ ] Resource monitoring shows improvement
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Monitor polling patterns to optimize intervals further
- Consider implementing predictive polling based on user behavior
- Test with various system configurations and load levels
- Ensure polling doesn't interfere with other application operations
