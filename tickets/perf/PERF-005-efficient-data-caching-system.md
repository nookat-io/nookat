# [PERF-005] Implement efficient data caching system

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive caching system to reduce redundant API calls, improve response times, and optimize resource usage across the application.

## Description

The application currently makes frequent API calls to Docker Engine for the same data, leading to unnecessary network overhead and slower response times. We need to implement intelligent caching with proper invalidation strategies to serve frequently requested data from memory while ensuring data freshness.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data
- Add cache invalidation strategies based on data volatility
- Create cache size management and cleanup
- Implement cache warming for critical data
- Add cache performance monitoring and metrics

### Backend

- Implement server-side caching for Docker API responses
- Create intelligent cache invalidation based on Docker events
- Add cache compression and serialization optimization
- Implement cache persistence across application restarts
- Create cache hit/miss analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. Frontend requests data from backend
2. Backend checks cache for existing data
3. If cache hit, return cached data immediately
4. If cache miss, fetch from Docker API and cache result
5. Cache is invalidated when Docker events indicate data changes
6. Cache size is managed to prevent memory overflow

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Container list cached with 5-minute TTL
- [ ] Image data cached with 10-minute TTL
- [ ] Network and volume data cached with 15-minute TTL
- [ ] Cache invalidation triggered by Docker events
- [ ] Cache persistence across application restarts
- [ ] Cache warming for critical data on startup
- [ ] Manual cache refresh option available

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80% for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Response time improvement of 60% for cached data
- [ ] Memory usage increase < 50MB for caching system
- [ ] Cache invalidation latency < 100ms
- [ ] Cache persistence doesn't exceed 10MB on disk

### User Experience

- [ ] Faster loading times for frequently accessed data
- [ ] No stale data displayed to users
- [ ] Clear indication when data is being refreshed
- [ ] Consistent performance regardless of network conditions
- [ ] Smooth transitions when cache is invalidated

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Cache management system
// Invalidation strategies
// Persistence layer
// Compression and serialization
// Cache analytics
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Client-side cache
// Cache invalidation
// Cache warming
// Performance monitoring
// Cache size management
```

## Dependencies

- Caching library (Redis or in-memory)
- Serialization framework
- Compression library
- Cache invalidation system
- Performance monitoring tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Caching system implemented for all data types
- [ ] Cache invalidation working based on Docker events
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (60% improvement)
- [ ] Cache persistence working across restarts
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80% achieved
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] Cache warming implemented for critical data
- [ ] Tests written for caching functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust TTL values accordingly
- Implement cache warming strategies based on user patterns
- Consider implementing cache compression for large datasets
- Ensure cache invalidation doesn't cause UI flickering
