# [PERF-003] Implement memory optimization for large container datasets

## Overview

Optimize memory usage when handling large numbers of containers (1000+) to prevent performance degradation and ensure smooth application operation.

## Description

The current implementation loads all container data into memory simultaneously, which becomes problematic with large datasets. We need to implement virtual scrolling, data virtualization, and memory-efficient data structures to handle thousands of containers without impacting performance or user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement virtual scrolling for container lists
- Add data virtualization for large datasets
- Create memory-efficient data structures
- Implement lazy loading for container details
- Add memory usage monitoring and cleanup

### Backend

- Optimize data structures for memory efficiency
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Add memory monitoring and garbage collection
- Create efficient data serialization
- Implement data compression for large datasets

### Data Flow

1. Backend receives request for container data
2. Data is paginated and compressed before transmission
3. Frontend receives only visible data plus buffer
4. Virtual scrolling renders only visible containers
5. Memory is cleaned up for off-screen items

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Application handles 1000+ containers without performance degradation
- [ ] Virtual scrolling works smoothly for large container lists
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable regardless of container count
- [ ] Container details load on-demand only when needed
- [ ] Search and filtering work efficiently on large datasets
- [ ] Bulk operations remain responsive with large datasets

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Memory usage increase < 20MB per 1000 containers
- [ ] Initial load time < 2 seconds for 1000 containers
- [ ] Scroll performance maintained at 60fps
- [ ] Memory cleanup occurs automatically
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use

### User Experience

- [ ] Smooth scrolling through large container lists
- [ ] No UI freezing when loading large datasets
- [ ] Responsive search and filtering
- [ ] Clear loading indicators for large operations
- [ ] Consistent performance regardless of dataset size

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation
