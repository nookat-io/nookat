# [DIST-001] Create bundle with Docker Engine option

## Overview

Implement a bundled distribution option that includes Docker Engine installation, allowing users to install both Nookat and Docker Engine in a single package.

## Description

Users need a convenient way to install both Nookat and Docker Engine together. We need to implement a bundled distribution that provides an all-in-one installation package with Docker Engine included.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement bundle installation interface
- Create Docker Engine installation wizard
- Add bundle configuration and options
- Implement installation progress tracking
- Create bundle verification and validation
- Add bundle troubleshooting and support

### Backend

- Implement bundle creation and packaging
- Create Docker Engine installation automation
- Add bundle validation and verification
- Implement installation progress monitoring
- Create bundle configuration management
- Add bundle troubleshooting tools

### Data Flow

1. User downloads bundled package
2. Bundle installer extracts and validates
3. Docker Engine is installed automatically
4. Nookat is installed and configured
5. Installation progress is tracked
6. Bundle verification is performed
