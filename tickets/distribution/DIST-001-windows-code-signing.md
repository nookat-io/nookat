**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Windows users need secure and trusted applications that meet Microsoft's security requirements. Currently, our application lacks proper code signing for Windows, which can trigger security warnings, prevent installation, and reduce user trust. Windows Defender SmartScreen and other security tools flag unsigned applications as potentially unsafe.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Implement comprehensive Windows code signing that includes:

- **Code Signing Certificate Management**: Secure storage and management of Windows Authenticode certificates
- **Automated Signing Process**: Integration with build pipeline to automatically sign Windows executables and installers
- **Timestamping**: Include RFC 3161 timestamping to ensure signatures remain valid after certificate expiration
- **Multiple File Types**: Support for signing .exe, .msi, .dll, and other Windows executable formats
- **Verification Interface**: Frontend interface to display signing status and certificate information
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for signing failures with clear user feedback

The solution should integrate seamlessly with our existing Tauri build process and provide clear feedback about signing status in the application.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

- Manual signing process: Too error-prone and doesn't scale with automated builds
- Third-party signing services: Could work but adds external dependency and potential security concerns
- Self-signed certificates: Not suitable for production as they don't provide user trust
- No signing: Not viable as it significantly impacts user adoption and security compliance

**Additional context**

- This is part of a broader code signing initiative across all platforms
- macOS code signing is already implemented
- Linux code signing will be handled in [DIST-014](./DIST-014-linux-code-signing.md)
- Windows code signing is critical for enterprise adoption and Microsoft Store distribution
- Consider using Azure Key Vault or similar secure certificate storage
- Must comply with Microsoft's code signing requirements and best practices
