# [DIST-006] Set up automated cross-platform build pipeline

## Overview

Implement an automated cross-platform build pipeline that builds, tests, and packages Nookat for macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms with minimal manual intervention.

## Description

Users need reliable builds across all supported platforms. We need to implement an automated cross-platform build pipeline that provides consistent builds, testing, and packaging for all target platforms.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement build pipeline monitoring interface
- Create build status and progress tracking
- Add build configuration and management
- Implement build artifact management
- Create build analytics and reporting
- Add build troubleshooting and support

### Backend

- Implement automated build pipeline logic
- Create cross-platform build orchestration
- Add build testing and validation
- Implement build artifact generation
- Create build analytics and reporting
- Add build configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Build pipeline is triggered automatically
2. Cross-platform builds are orchestrated
3. Builds are tested and validated
4. Build artifacts are generated and stored
5. Build analytics are collected and reported
6. Build configuration is managed and updated

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Build pipeline monitoring interface
- [ ] Build status and progress tracking
- [ ] Build configuration and management
- [ ] Build artifact management
- [ ] Build analytics and reporting
- [ ] Build troubleshooting and support
- [ ] Support for macOS, Windows, and Linux

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Build pipeline completes within 30 minutes
- [ ] Build status updates every 30 seconds
- [ ] Build artifacts are generated within 10 minutes
- [ ] Automated build pipeline works across all platforms
- [ ] System handles build failures gracefully

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive build pipeline monitoring interface
- [ ] Clear build status and progress tracking
- [ ] Helpful build configuration and management
- [ ] Professional build analytics and reporting
- [ ] Seamless build pipeline workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Automated build pipeline logic
// Cross-platform build orchestration
// Build testing and validation
// Build artifact generation
// Build analytics and reporting
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Build pipeline monitoring interface
// Build status and progress tracking
// Build configuration and management
// Build artifact management
// Build analytics and reporting
```

## Dependencies

- CI/CD pipeline framework
- Cross-platform build tools
- Build testing framework
- Build artifact management system
- Build analytics and reporting framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Automated build pipeline implemented
- [ ] Build status and progress tracking working
- [ ] Build configuration and management functional
- [ ] Build artifact management operational
- [ ] Support for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- [ ] Tests written for automated build pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing parallel build execution
- Ensure build pipeline works with various build configurations
- Test build pipeline with different platform scenarios
- Monitor build pipeline performance and optimize
