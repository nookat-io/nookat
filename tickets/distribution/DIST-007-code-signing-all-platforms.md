# [DIST-007] Implement code signing for all platforms

## Overview

Implement code signing for macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms to ensure application security, trust, and compliance with platform requirements.

## Description

Users need secure and trusted applications that meet platform security requirements. We need to implement code signing that provides application verification, security compliance, and platform trust for all supported platforms.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement code signing status interface
- Create code signing configuration and management
- Add code signing verification and validation
- Implement code signing certificate management
- Create code signing analytics and reporting
- Add code signing troubleshooting and support

### Backend

- Implement code signing logic
- Create code signing automation for all platforms
- Add code signing verification and validation
- Implement code signing certificate management
- Create code signing analytics and reporting
- Add code signing configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Code signing certificates are configured
2. Application is signed for each platform
3. Code signing verification is performed
4. Signed applications are distributed
5. Code signing analytics are collected
6. Code signing status is tracked
