**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Linux users need secure and trusted applications that meet distribution security requirements. Currently, our application lacks proper code signing for Linux, which can prevent installation on secure systems, trigger package manager warnings, and reduce user trust. Many Linux distributions and security tools require signed packages for installation.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Implement comprehensive Linux code signing that includes:

- **GPG Signing**: Use GPG keys to sign application packages and repositories
- **Package Signing**: Support for signing .deb, .rpm, .AppImage, and other Linux package formats
- **Repository Signing**: Sign package repositories for secure package management
- **Certificate Management**: Secure storage and management of GPG keys and certificates
- **Automated Signing Process**: Integration with build pipeline to automatically sign Linux packages
- **Verification Interface**: Frontend interface to display signing status and key information
- **Multiple Distribution Support**: Support for Ubuntu/Debian (.deb), Red Hat/Fedora (.rpm), and universal formats (.AppImage)

The solution should integrate with our existing build process and provide clear feedback about signing status, making it easy for users to verify application authenticity.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

- Manual signing process: Too error-prone and doesn't scale with automated builds
- No signing: Not viable as it prevents installation on secure systems and reduces trust
- Third-party signing services: Could work but adds external dependency
- Self-signed certificates: Limited trust value, better than no signing but not ideal
- Distribution-specific signing: Too complex to maintain multiple signing processes

**Additional context**

- This is part of a broader code signing initiative across all platforms
- macOS code signing is already implemented
- Windows code signing will be handled in [DIST-011](./DIST-011-windows-code-signing.md)
- Linux code signing is important for enterprise Linux environments and secure distributions
- Consider integration with package managers like apt, yum, dnf, and snap
- Must comply with Linux distribution security requirements and best practices
- GPG key management and distribution is crucial for user trust
