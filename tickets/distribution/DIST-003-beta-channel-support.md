# [DIST-003] Add beta channel support

## Overview

Implement beta channel support that allows users to opt into early access to new features and updates before they are released to the stable channel.

## Description

Users need access to beta features for testing and early feedback. We need to implement beta channel support that provides beta version distribution, feedback collection, and beta-specific features.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement beta channel interface
- Create beta version selection and switching
- Add beta feedback collection and reporting
- Implement beta feature toggles and settings
- Create beta update notifications
- Add beta channel configuration and management

### Backend

- Implement beta channel logic
- Create beta version distribution and management
- Add beta feedback collection and processing
- Implement beta feature flags and toggles
- Create beta update notifications
- Add beta channel configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User opts into beta channel
2. Beta versions are distributed and managed
3. Beta features are enabled and configured
4. Beta feedback is collected and processed
5. Beta updates are notified and installed
6. Beta channel configuration is maintained

## Acceptance Criteria
