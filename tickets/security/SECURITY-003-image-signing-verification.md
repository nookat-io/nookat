# [SECURITY-003] Add image signing verification

## Overview

Implement image signing verification that validates Docker image signatures, ensures image integrity, and provides trust verification for secure image deployment.

## Description

Users need to verify Docker image signatures to ensure image integrity and authenticity. We need to implement image signing verification that validates signatures, checks trust chains, and provides verification status reporting.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement image signing verification interface
- Create signature validation and status display
- Add trust chain verification and reporting
- Implement verification history and tracking
- Create verification configuration and management
- Add verification help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement image signature verification
- Create trust chain validation
- Add signature validation and checking
- Implement verification status tracking
- Create verification analytics and reporting
- Add verification configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User selects image for signature verification
2. Image signature is extracted and validated
3. Trust chain is verified and checked
4. Verification status is determined and reported
5. Verification history is tracked and stored
6. Verification results are displayed to user
