# [SECURITY-005] Implement container security scanning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive container security scanning that detects security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and security risks in running containers and their configurations.

## Description

Users need to scan running containers for security vulnerabilities and compliance issues. We need to implement container security scanning that provides real-time security analysis, vulnerability detection, and compliance checking for active containers.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement container security scanning interface
- Create security scan results visualization
- Add vulnerability details and remediation
- Implement compliance checking and reporting
- Create security scan scheduling and automation
- Add security scan history and tracking

### Backend

- Implement container security scanning logic
- Create vulnerability detection algorithms
- Add compliance checking and validation
- Implement security scan scheduling
- Create security analytics and reporting
- Add security scan configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User initiates container security scan
2. Running containers are analyzed for vulnerabilities
3. Security issues are detected and categorized
4. Compliance checks are performed
5. Remediation recommendations are generated
6. Scan results are reported and stored

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Container security scanning interface
- [ ] Security scan results visualization
- [ ] Vulnerability details and remediation
- [ ] Compliance checking and reporting
- [ ] Security scan scheduling and automation
- [ ] Security scan history and tracking
- [ ] Support for multiple security standards

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Security scan completes within 5 minutes
- [ ] Scan results load within 2 seconds
- [ ] Vulnerability detection responds within 1 second
- [ ] Container security scanning works across all platforms
