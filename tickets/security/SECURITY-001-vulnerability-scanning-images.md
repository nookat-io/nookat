# [SECURITY-001] Integrate vulnerability scanning for images

## Overview

Implement comprehensive vulnerability scanning for Docker images that detects security vulnerabilities, provides detailed reports, and offers remediation recommendations.

## Description

Users need to scan Docker images for security vulnerabilities to ensure secure deployments. We need to implement vulnerability scanning that integrates with security tools, provides detailed vulnerability reports, and offers remediation guidance.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement vulnerability scanning interface
- Create scan results visualization and reporting
- Add vulnerability details and remediation guidance
- Implement scan scheduling and automation
- Create vulnerability history and tracking
- Add scan configuration and management

### Backend

- Implement vulnerability scanning integration
- Create scan result processing and analysis
- Add vulnerability database integration
- Implement scan scheduling and automation
- Create vulnerability reporting and analytics
- Add scan configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User initiates vulnerability scan for image
2. Scan is performed using security tools
3. Scan results are processed and analyzed
4. Vulnerabilities are categorized and reported
5. Remediation guidance is provided
6. Scan history is tracked and stored
