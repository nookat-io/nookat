# [SECURITY-006] Add policy enforcement framework

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive policy enforcement framework that allows users to define, configure, and enforce security policies for containers and applications.

## Description

Users need to enforce security policies to ensure compliance and maintain security standards. We need to implement a policy enforcement framework that provides policy definition, configuration, monitoring, and enforcement capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement policy enforcement framework interface
- Create policy definition and configuration
- Add policy monitoring and enforcement
- Implement policy violation alerts
- Create policy compliance reporting
- Add policy customization and management

### Backend

- Implement policy enforcement framework logic
- Create policy definition and validation
- Add policy monitoring and enforcement
- Implement policy violation detection
- Create policy compliance analytics
- Add policy configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User defines and configures security policies
2. Policies are validated and deployed
3. Policy monitoring is active and continuous
4. Policy violations are detected and alerted
5. Compliance reports are generated
6. Policy enforcement results are tracked
