# [SECURITY-009] Add vulnerability management system

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive vulnerability management system that tracks, prioritizes, and manages security vulnerabilities across containers and applications.

## Description

Users need to manage security vulnerabilities effectively to maintain system security. We need to implement a vulnerability management system that provides vulnerability tracking, prioritization, remediation planning, and risk assessment.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement vulnerability management system interface
- Create vulnerability tracking and prioritization
- Add vulnerability remediation planning
- Implement risk assessment and scoring
- Create vulnerability reporting and analytics
- Add vulnerability configuration and management

### Backend

- Implement vulnerability management system logic
- Create vulnerability tracking and prioritization
- Add vulnerability remediation planning
- Implement risk assessment algorithms
- Create vulnerability analytics and reporting
- Add vulnerability configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Vulnerabilities are detected and tracked
2. Vulnerabilities are prioritized and scored
3. Remediation plans are created and managed
4. Risk assessments are performed
5. Vulnerability reports are generated
6. Vulnerability management results are tracked

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Vulnerability management system interface
- [ ] Vulnerability tracking and prioritization
- [ ] Vulnerability remediation planning
- [ ] Risk assessment and scoring
- [ ] Vulnerability reporting and analytics
- [ ] Vulnerability configuration and management
- [ ] Support for multiple vulnerability types

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Vulnerability management interface loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Vulnerability tracking responds within 1 second
- [ ] Risk assessment completes within 3 seconds
- [ ] Vulnerability management system works across all platforms
- [ ] System handles large vulnerability datasets

### User Experience
