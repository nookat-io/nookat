# [SECURITY-002] Implement image layer analysis

## Overview

Implement comprehensive image layer analysis that examines Docker image layers for security issues, optimization opportunities, and detailed layer composition.

## Description

Users need to analyze Docker image layers to understand their composition, identify security issues, and optimize image size. We need to implement layer analysis that provides detailed insights into image structure, security vulnerabilities, and optimization recommendations.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement image layer analysis interface
- Create layer visualization and composition display
- Add layer security analysis and reporting
- Implement layer optimization suggestions
- Create layer comparison and diffing
- Add layer analysis history and tracking

### Backend

- Implement image layer analysis engine
- Create layer composition analysis
- Add layer security scanning
- Implement layer optimization analysis
- Create layer comparison and diffing
- Add layer analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User selects image for layer analysis
2. Image layers are extracted and analyzed
3. Layer composition is determined and visualized
4. Security issues are identified in layers
5. Optimization suggestions are generated
6. Layer analysis results are reported
