# [IMAGE-003] Add multi-stage build support

## Overview

Implement multi-stage build support that allows users to create efficient Docker images using multiple build stages with optimized layer caching and reduced final image size.

## Description

Users need to create efficient Docker images using multi-stage builds to reduce image size and improve build performance. We need to implement multi-stage build support with stage management, layer optimization, and build visualization.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement multi-stage build interface
- Create stage management and configuration
- Add build stage visualization
- Implement stage dependency management
- Create build optimization suggestions
- Add multi-stage build templates

### Backend

- Implement multi-stage build orchestration
- Create stage dependency analysis
- Add build stage optimization
- Implement layer caching management
- Create build stage analytics
- Add multi-stage build validation

### Data Flow

1. User configures multi-stage build
2. Build stages are analyzed and optimized
3. Stage dependencies are managed
4. Build stages are executed in order
5. Layer caching is optimized
6. Final image is created efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Multi-stage build interface
- [ ] Stage management and configuration
- [ ] Build stage visualization
- [ ] Stage dependency management
- [ ] Build optimization suggestions
- [ ] Multi-stage build templates
- [ ] Layer caching optimization

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Multi-stage build configuration saves within 500ms
- [ ] Build stage analysis completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Stage execution starts within 1 second
- [ ] Layer caching reduces build time by 40%
- [ ] Multi-stage builds work with complex configurations

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive multi-stage build interface
- [ ] Clear stage management and visualization
- [ ] Helpful build optimization suggestions
- [ ] Professional multi-stage build management
- [ ] Seamless multi-stage build workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Multi-stage build orchestration

// Build stage visualization
// Dependency management
// Optimization suggestions
```

## Dependencies

- Multi-stage build orchestration library
- Stage dependency analysis framework
- Layer caching optimization utilities
- Build stage analytics tools
- Validation and testing framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Multi-stage build support implemented
- [ ] Stage management and configuration working
- [ ] Build stage visualization functional
- [ ] Stage dependency management operational
