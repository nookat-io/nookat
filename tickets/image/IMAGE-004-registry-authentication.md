# [IMAGE-004] Implement registry authentication

## Overview

Implement comprehensive registry authentication that allows users to authenticate with Docker Hub and other container registries for secure image push/pull operations.

## Description

Users need to authenticate with container registries to push and pull images securely. We need to implement registry authentication that supports Docker Hub, private registries, and other container registries with secure credential management.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement registry authentication interface
- Create registry configuration and management
- Add secure credential storage
- Implement authentication status monitoring
- Create registry connection testing
- Add authentication help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement registry authentication protocols
- Create secure credential management
- Add registry connection management
- Implement authentication validation
- Create registry configuration storage
- Add authentication logging and auditing

### Data Flow

1. User configures registry authentication
2. Credentials are securely stored and managed
3. Authentication is validated with registry
4. Connection is tested and monitored
5. Authentication status is tracked
6. Secure operations are performed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Registry authentication interface
- [ ] Registry configuration and management
- [ ] Secure credential storage
- [ ] Authentication status monitoring
- [ ] Registry connection testing
- [ ] Authentication help and documentation
- [ ] Multi-registry support

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Authentication configuration saves within 200ms
- [ ] Authentication validation completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Connection testing completes within 3 seconds
- [ ] Credentials are encrypted and secure
- [ ] Authentication works across all supported platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive registry authentication interface
- [ ] Clear authentication status and configuration
- [ ] Helpful authentication setup guidance
- [ ] Professional authentication management
- [ ] Seamless registry authentication workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Registry authentication protocols
// Secure credential management
// Connection management
// Authentication validation
// Configuration storage
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Registry authentication interface
// Configuration and management
// Status monitoring
// Connection testing
// Help and documentation
```

## Dependencies

- Registry authentication library
- Secure credential management framework
- Connection testing utilities
- Configuration management system
- Logging and auditing framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Registry authentication implemented
- [ ] Registry configuration working
- [ ] Secure credential storage functional
- [ ] Authentication status monitoring operational
- [ ] Registry connection testing
- [ ] Multi-registry support
- [ ] Tests written for registry authentication
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing OAuth2 authentication
- Ensure authentication works with various registry types
- Test authentication with different credential types
- Monitor authentication security and optimize
