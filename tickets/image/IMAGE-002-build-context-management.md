# [IMAGE-002] Implement build context management

## Overview

Implement comprehensive build context management that allows users to manage, organize, and optimize Docker build contexts for efficient image building.

## Description

Users need to manage Docker build contexts effectively to optimize image building and reduce build times. We need to implement a build context management system that provides context organization, optimization, and efficient build processes.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement build context management interface
- Create build context organization and structure
- Add build context optimization tools
- Implement build context validation
- Create build context templates and presets
- Add build context monitoring and analytics

### Backend

- Implement build context analysis and optimization
- Create build context validation and testing
- Add build context storage and retrieval
- Implement build context caching
- Create build context analytics and reporting
- Add build context version control integration

### Data Flow

1. User selects or creates build context
2. Build context is analyzed and optimized
3. Build context is validated for completeness
4. Build context is cached for efficiency
5. Build context analytics are generated
6. Build context can be shared and reused

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Build context management interface
- [ ] Build context organization and structure
- [ ] Build context optimization tools
- [ ] Build context validation
- [ ] Build context templates and presets
- [ ] Build context monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Build context caching and reuse

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Build context analysis completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Build context validation within 1 second
- [ ] Build context optimization reduces size by 30%
- [ ] Build context caching improves build speed by 50%
- [ ] Build context management works with large projects

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive build context management interface
- [ ] Clear build context organization
- [ ] Helpful optimization tools
- [ ] Professional build context management
- [ ] Seamless build context workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation
