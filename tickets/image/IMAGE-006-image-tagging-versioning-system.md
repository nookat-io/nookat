# [IMAGE-006] Create image tagging and versioning system

## Overview

Implement comprehensive image tagging and versioning system that allows users to manage image tags, versions, and release management with semantic versioning support.

## Description

Users need to manage image tags and versions effectively for proper image organization and release management. We need to implement a tagging and versioning system that provides semantic versioning, tag management, and release tracking.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement image tagging and versioning interface
- Create tag management and organization
- Add semantic versioning support
- Implement version comparison and diffing
- Create release management and tracking
- Add tagging automation and workflows

### Backend

- Implement image tagging operations
- Create semantic versioning logic
- Add tag validation and management
- Implement version comparison and analysis
- Create release tracking and analytics
- Add tagging automation and workflows

### Data Flow

1. User creates or manages image tags
2. Tags are validated and organized
3. Semantic versioning is applied
4. Version comparisons are performed
5. Release tracking is updated
6. Tagging workflows are automated

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Image tagging and versioning interface
- [ ] Tag management and organization
- [ ] Semantic versioning support
- [ ] Version comparison and diffing
- [ ] Release management and tracking
- [ ] Tagging automation and workflows
- [ ] Tag validation and management

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Tag operations complete within 500ms
- [ ] Version comparison completes within 1 second
- [ ] Tag validation responds within 200ms
- [ ] Tagging system works with large image sets
- [ ] Tagging system works across all platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive tagging and versioning interface
- [ ] Clear tag management and organization
- [ ] Helpful version comparison features
- [ ] Professional tagging management
- [ ] Seamless tagging workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Image tagging operations
// Semantic versioning logic
// Tag validation and management
// Version comparison and analysis
// Release tracking and analytics
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Image tagging and versioning interface
// Tag management and organization
// Semantic versioning support
// Version comparison and diffing
// Release management and tracking
```

## Dependencies

- Image tagging library
- Semantic versioning framework
- Tag validation utilities
- Version comparison tools
- Release tracking framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Image tagging and versioning system implemented
- [ ] Tag management and organization working
- [ ] Semantic versioning support functional
- [ ] Version comparison and diffing operational
- [ ] Release management and tracking
- [ ] Tagging automation and workflows
- [ ] Tests written for tagging and versioning system
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing automated tagging workflows
- Ensure tagging system works with various image types
- Test tagging system with complex versioning scenarios
- Monitor tagging system performance and optimize
