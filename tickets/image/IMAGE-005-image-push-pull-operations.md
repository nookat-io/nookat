# [IMAGE-005] Add image push/pull operations

## Overview

Implement comprehensive image push/pull operations that allow users to push images to registries and pull images from registries with progress tracking and error handling.

## Description

Users need to push images to registries and pull images from registries with proper progress tracking and error handling. We need to implement push/pull operations that provide real-time progress, error handling, and efficient image transfer.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement image push/pull interface
- Create progress tracking and visualization
- Add operation status monitoring
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Create operation history and logging
- Add operation configuration and management

### Backend

- Implement image push/pull operations
- Create progress tracking and reporting
- Add operation error handling
- Implement operation retry mechanisms
- Create operation history and analytics
- Add operation configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User initiates push/pull operation
2. Operation progress is tracked in real-time
3. Operation status is monitored and displayed
4. Errors are handled and recovery attempted
5. Operation history is logged
6. Operation results are reported

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Image push/pull interface
- [ ] Progress tracking and visualization
- [ ] Operation status monitoring
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Operation history and logging
- [ ] Operation configuration and management
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed operations

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Push/pull operations start within 1 second
- [ ] Progress updates occur within 500ms
- [ ] Error handling responds within 200ms
- [ ] Operations work with large images
- [ ] Push/pull operations work across all platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive push/pull operation interface
- [ ] Clear progress tracking and status
- [ ] Helpful error messages and recovery
- [ ] Professional operation management
- [ ] Seamless push/pull workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Image push/pull operations
// Progress tracking and reporting
// Error handling and recovery
// Retry mechanisms
// History and analytics
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Image push/pull interface
// Progress tracking and visualization
// Status monitoring
// Error handling and recovery
// History and logging
```

## Dependencies

- Image push/pull library
- Progress tracking framework
- Error handling utilities
- Retry mechanism framework
- History and analytics tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Image push/pull operations implemented
- [ ] Progress tracking and visualization working
- [ ] Operation status monitoring functional
- [ ] Error handling and recovery operational
- [ ] Operation history and logging
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Tests written for push/pull operations
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing parallel push/pull operations
- Ensure operations work with various image sizes
- Test operations with different network conditions
- Monitor operation performance and optimize
