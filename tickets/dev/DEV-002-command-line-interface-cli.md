# [DEV-002] Create command-line interface (CLI) and make it available in the OS terminal

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) that provides terminal access to Docker management features and makes it available as a system command.

## Description

Users need command-line access to Docker management features for automation and scripting. We need to implement a CLI that provides terminal-based Docker management capabilities and integrates with the operating system's command line environment.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement CLI interface and command structure
- Create command help and documentation
- Add command completion and suggestions
- Implement command output formatting
- Create CLI configuration and settings
- Add CLI installation and setup

### Backend

- Implement CLI logic and command processing
- Create command parsing and validation
- Add command execution and handling
- Implement CLI configuration management
- Create CLI installation and distribution
- Add CLI analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User enters CLI command in terminal
2. Command is parsed and validated
3. Command is executed and processed
4. Results are formatted and displayed
5. Command history is tracked
6. CLI configuration is managed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] CLI interface and command structure
- [ ] Command help and documentation
- [ ] Command completion and suggestions
- [ ] Command output formatting
- [ ] CLI configuration and settings
- [ ] CLI installation and setup
- [ ] Support for multiple command types

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CLI commands respond within 1 second
- [ ] Command completion responds within 200ms
- [ ] CLI installation completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] CLI works across all supported platforms
- [ ] CLI integrates with system PATH

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive CLI interface and command structure
- [ ] Clear command help and documentation
- [ ] Helpful command completion and suggestions
- [ ] Professional command output formatting
- [ ] Seamless CLI installation and setup

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// CLI logic and command processing
