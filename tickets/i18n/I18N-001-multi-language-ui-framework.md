# [I18N-001] Implement multi-language UI framework

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive multi-language UI framework that supports internationalization and localization for multiple languages with dynamic language switching.

## Description

Users need to use the application in their preferred language. We need to implement a multi-language UI framework that provides internationalization support, dynamic language switching, and comprehensive localization capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement multi-language UI framework
- Create language selection interface
- Add dynamic language switching
- Implement translation management system
- Create locale-specific formatting
- Add language detection and fallback

### Backend

- Implement internationalization framework
- Create translation management system
- Add locale-specific data handling
- Implement language detection logic
- Create translation validation and testing
- Add language configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User selects or system detects preferred language
2. Language configuration is loaded and applied
3. UI components are translated and updated
4. Locale-specific formatting is applied
5. Language switching is handled dynamically
6. Translation fallbacks are managed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Multi-language UI framework
- [ ] Language selection interface
- [ ] Dynamic language switching
- [ ] Translation management system
- [ ] Locale-specific formatting
- [ ] Language detection and fallback
- [ ] Support for multiple languages

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Language switching completes within 1 second
- [ ] Translation loading responds within 500ms
- [ ] UI updates occur within 200ms
- [ ] Multi-language framework works across all platforms
- [ ] Language detection works automatically

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive language selection interface
- [ ] Seamless language switching
- [ ] Consistent translation quality
- [ ] Professional multi-language experience
- [ ] Smooth language transition workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Internationalization framework
// Translation management system
// Locale-specific data handling
// Language detection logic
// Translation validation and testing
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Multi-language UI framework
// Language selection interface
// Dynamic language switching
// Translation management system
// Locale-specific formatting
```

## Dependencies

- Internationalization library
- Translation management framework
- Locale-specific formatting utilities
- Language detection tools
- Translation validation framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Multi-language UI framework implemented
- [ ] Language selection interface working
- [ ] Dynamic language switching functional
- [ ] Translation management system operational
- [ ] Locale-specific formatting
- [ ] Support for multiple languages
- [ ] Tests written for multi-language framework
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing translation memory
- Ensure framework works with various UI components
- Test framework with different language scripts
- Monitor multi-language performance and optimize
