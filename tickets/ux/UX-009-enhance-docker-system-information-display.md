# [UX-009] Enhance Docker system information display

## Overview

Enhance the Docker system information display to provide more comprehensive and detailed information about the Docker Engine, system resources, and configuration.

## Description

Users need more detailed and comprehensive Docker system information to better understand their Docker environment. We need to enhance the system information display to provide detailed insights into Docker Engine status, system resources, and configuration details.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement enhanced system information interface
- Create detailed Docker Engine status display
- Add system resource monitoring and visualization
- Implement configuration details display
- Create system information export and reporting
- Add system information refresh and updates

### Backend

- Implement enhanced system information logic
- Create detailed Docker Engine status monitoring
- Add system resource collection and analysis
- Implement configuration details retrieval
- Create system information analytics and reporting
- Add system information caching and optimization

### Data Flow

1. System information is collected from Docker Engine
2. System resources are monitored and analyzed
3. Configuration details are retrieved and processed
4. Enhanced information is displayed and updated
5. System information is cached and optimized
6. System information analytics are generated
