# [UX-006] Enhance loading states and error handling

## Overview

Enhance loading states and error handling to provide better user feedback, clearer error messages, and improved user experience during operations.

## Description

Users need better feedback during operations and clearer error messages when issues occur. We need to enhance loading states and error handling to provide improved user feedback, clearer error messages, and better user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement enhanced loading states
- Create improved error handling interface
- Add loading progress indicators
- Implement error message display and recovery
- Create loading state management
- Add error handling configuration and management

### Backend

- Implement enhanced loading state logic
- Create improved error handling mechanisms
- Add loading progress tracking
- Implement error recovery and retry
- Create loading state analytics and reporting
- Add error handling configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Loading states are managed and displayed
2. Error conditions are detected and handled
3. Loading progress is tracked and reported
4. Error messages are displayed and managed
5. Error recovery mechanisms are executed
6. Loading and error analytics are collected
