# [UX-001] Unify loading spinners and error handling across all pages

## Overview

Standardize loading spinners and error handling across containers, images, volumes, and networks pages to provide a consistent user experience throughout the application.

## Description

Currently, different pages have inconsistent loading and error handling implementations. NetworksPage has full-screen loading/error states, ImagesPage handles them inline in the table, while ContainersPage and VolumesPage have no loading or error states at all. This creates an inconsistent and confusing user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Create unified loading component with consistent styling
- Implement standardized error handling component
- Add loading states to ContainersPage and VolumesPage
- Add error handling to ContainersPage and VolumesPage
- Ensure consistent spinner animations and styling
- Implement consistent retry mechanisms

### Backend

- No backend changes required
- Ensure all data providers return consistent loading/error states

### Data Flow

1. Data provider sets loading/error states
2. Page component receives loading/error states
3. Unified loading/error components render consistently
4. User sees consistent experience across all pages

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] All pages (containers, images, volumes, networks) have loading states
- [ ] All pages have error handling with retry functionality
- [ ] Loading spinners use consistent styling and animation
- [ ] Error messages follow consistent format and styling
- [ ] Retry buttons work consistently across all pages
- [ ] Loading states show appropriate context-specific messages

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Loading states appear within 100ms of data request
- [ ] Error states provide clear, actionable error messages
- [ ] Consistent visual design across all loading/error states
- [ ] No layout shifts when loading/error states appear
- [ ] Accessibility features (screen reader support) for all states

### User Experience

- [ ] Consistent loading experience across all pages
- [ ] Clear error messages with actionable retry options
- [ ] Smooth transitions between loading, error, and success states
- [ ] No confusion about application state
- [ ] Professional, polished appearance

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// No backend changes required
// Ensure consistent error handling in data providers
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Unified loading component
// Standardized error component
// Consistent spinner styling
// Retry mechanism implementation
// Page-specific loading/error integration
```

## Dependencies

- React component library for consistent styling
- Icon library for spinner animations
- State management for loading/error states
- Accessibility library for screen reader support

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Unified loading component created and implemented
- [ ] Standardized error component created and implemented
- [ ] All pages have consistent loading states
- [ ] All pages have consistent error handling
- [ ] Loading spinners use consistent styling
- [ ] Error messages follow consistent format
- [ ] Retry functionality works on all pages
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Tests written for loading/error components
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider creating reusable LoadingSpinner and ErrorDisplay components
- Ensure loading states don't interfere with real-time updates
- Test with various error scenarios (network, Docker daemon, etc.)
- Consider implementing skeleton loading for better perceived performance
