# [UX-001] Add local configuration storage system

## Overview

Implement a local configuration storage system to persist user preferences, application settings, and configuration data across application sessions.

## Description

The application currently doesn't persist user preferences or configuration settings, requiring users to reconfigure the application each time it starts. We need to implement a robust local storage system that saves and restores user preferences, application settings, and other configuration data.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement local storage management system
- Create configuration persistence and retrieval
- Add user preferences management and storage
- Implement configuration validation and migration
- Create configuration backup and restore functionality
- Add configuration synchronization across sessions

### Backend

- Implement secure local storage for sensitive data
- Create configuration encryption and security
- Add configuration validation and integrity checking
- Implement configuration migration and versioning
- Create configuration backup and recovery mechanisms
- Add configuration monitoring and analytics

### Data Flow

1. User modifies application settings or preferences
2. Configuration is validated and encrypted if needed
3. Configuration is stored in local storage
4. Configuration is retrieved on application startup
5. Configuration is validated and migrated if necessary
6. Application applies configuration settings

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] User preferences persist across application restarts
- [ ] Application settings are saved and restored
- [ ] Configuration data is properly encrypted for sensitive information
- [ ] Configuration validation prevents invalid settings
- [ ] Configuration migration handles version updates
- [ ] Configuration backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Configuration synchronization across multiple instances

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Configuration storage doesn't impact application startup time
- [ ] Configuration data is properly secured and encrypted
- [ ] Configuration validation completes within 100ms
- [ ] Configuration storage supports up to 10MB of data
- [ ] Configuration backup/restore completes within 5 seconds

### User Experience

- [ ] Seamless persistence of user preferences
- [ ] No configuration loss during application updates
- [ ] Clear feedback for configuration changes
- [ ] Easy access to configuration backup/restore
- [ ] Consistent application behavior across sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Local storage management
// Configuration encryption
// Configuration validation
// Migration and versioning
// Backup and recovery
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Configuration persistence
// User preferences management
// Configuration validation
// Migration handling
// Backup and restore UI
```

## Dependencies

- Local storage library for secure data persistence
- Encryption library for sensitive data
- Configuration validation framework
- Migration and versioning system
- Backup and restore utilities

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Local configuration storage system implemented
- [ ] User preferences persist across sessions
- [ ] Configuration validation and migration working
- [ ] Configuration backup and restore functional
- [ ] Sensitive data properly encrypted
- [ ] Configuration synchronization working
- [ ] Tests written for configuration system
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing configuration profiles for different use cases
- Ensure configuration storage doesn't interfere with application performance
- Test configuration migration with various data formats
- Monitor configuration storage usage and optimize as needed
