# [UX-001] Implement drag-and-drop files from/to container

## Overview

Implement drag-and-drop functionality that allows users to easily transfer files between their local system and Docker containers with visual feedback and progress tracking.

## Description

Users need to transfer files between their local system and Docker containers efficiently. We need to implement drag-and-drop functionality that provides intuitive file transfer, visual feedback, and progress tracking for seamless file management.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement drag-and-drop file transfer interface
- Create visual feedback and progress indicators
- Add file transfer validation and error handling
- Implement drag-and-drop zones and targets
- Create file transfer history and management
- Add file transfer help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement file transfer logic and processing
- Create file transfer validation and security
- Add file transfer progress tracking
- Implement file transfer error handling
- Create file transfer analytics and reporting
- Add file transfer configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User drags files to/from container
2. File transfer is validated and initiated
3. Transfer progress is tracked and displayed
4. Files are transferred with security checks
5. Transfer completion is confirmed
6. Transfer history is logged and managed

## Acceptance Criteria
