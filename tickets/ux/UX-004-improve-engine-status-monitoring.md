# [UX-004] Improve engine status monitoring

## Overview

Improve Docker Engine status monitoring to provide real-time status updates, health checks, and detailed engine diagnostics.

## Description

Users need better monitoring of Docker Engine status to ensure reliable container operations. We need to improve engine status monitoring to provide real-time status updates, health checks, and detailed engine diagnostics.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement improved engine status monitoring interface
- Create real-time engine status display
- Add engine health checks and diagnostics
- Implement engine status alerts and notifications
- Create engine status history and tracking
- Add engine status configuration and management

### Backend

- Implement improved engine status monitoring logic
- Create real-time engine status checking
- Add engine health checks and diagnostics
- Implement engine status alerts and notifications
- Create engine status analytics and reporting
- Add engine status configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Engine status is monitored in real-time
2. Engine health checks are performed
3. Engine diagnostics are collected and analyzed
4. Engine status alerts are triggered
5. Engine status history is tracked
6. Engine status configuration is managed
