# [UX-007] Optimize cross-platform compatibility

## Overview

Optimize cross-platform compatibility to ensure consistent user experience and functionality across macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms.

## Description

Users need a consistent experience across all supported platforms. We need to optimize cross-platform compatibility to provide consistent functionality, platform-specific optimizations, and unified user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement cross-platform compatibility optimizations
- Create platform-specific UI adaptations
- Add cross-platform interaction handling
- Implement platform-specific features
- Create cross-platform testing and validation
- Add cross-platform configuration management

### Backend

- Implement cross-platform compatibility logic
- Create platform detection and adaptation
- Add cross-platform functionality handling
- Implement platform-specific optimizations
- Create cross-platform analytics and reporting
- Add cross-platform configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Platform is detected and analyzed
2. Platform-specific optimizations are applied
3. Cross-platform functionality is handled
4. Platform-specific features are enabled
5. Cross-platform testing is performed
6. Cross-platform configuration is managed
