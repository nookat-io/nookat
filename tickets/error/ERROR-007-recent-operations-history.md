# [ERROR-007] Add recent operations history tracking

## Overview

Implement a recent operations history system that tracks user actions, provides operation history, and enables users to review and potentially redo previous operations.

## Description

Currently, users have no way to see what operations they've performed or review their recent actions. We need to implement a comprehensive operations history system that tracks user actions, provides detailed operation logs, and enables users to understand their recent activity.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement operations history tracking system
- Create operations history display and management
- Add operation details and metadata storage
- Implement operation search and filtering
- Create operation history export functionality
- Add operation history cleanup and retention policies

### Backend

- Implement operations logging and storage
- Create operation metadata and context tracking
- Add operation history persistence and retrieval
- Implement operation history analytics and reporting
- Create operation history backup and recovery
- Add operation history security and privacy controls

### Data Flow

1. User performs an operation (start container, delete image, etc.)
2. Operation is logged with metadata and context
3. Operation history is stored and indexed
4. User can view and search operation history
5. Operation history is cleaned up based on retention policy
6. Operation analytics are collected for insights

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] All user operations are tracked and logged
- [ ] Operation history is searchable and filterable
- [ ] Operation details include metadata and context
- [ ] Operation history retention policy is configurable
- [ ] Operation history export functionality
- [ ] Operation history cleanup and maintenance
- [ ] Operation history privacy and security controls

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Operation logging doesn't impact application performance
- [ ] Operation history search completes within 200ms
- [ ] Operation history storage supports up to 1000 operations
- [ ] Operation history cleanup runs automatically
- [ ] Operation history data is properly secured

### User Experience

- [ ] Easy access to recent operations
- [ ] Clear operation details and context
- [ ] Intuitive operation history interface
- [ ] Helpful operation history search
- [ ] Professional operation history presentation

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Operations logging system
// Operation metadata tracking
// History persistence and retrieval
// Analytics and reporting
// Security and privacy controls
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Operations history tracking
// History display and management
// Search and filtering
// Export functionality
// Cleanup and retention
```

## Dependencies

- Operations logging library
- History storage and retrieval system
- Search and filtering framework
- Analytics and reporting tools
- Security and privacy controls

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Operations history tracking system implemented
- [ ] All operations are properly logged and tracked
- [ ] Operation history search and filtering working
- [ ] Operation history export functionality
- [ ] Operation history cleanup and retention
- [ ] Operation history security controls
- [ ] Tests written for operations history
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing operation undo/redo functionality
- Ensure operation history doesn't expose sensitive information
- Test operation history with high-volume usage scenarios
- Monitor operation history performance and optimize as needed
