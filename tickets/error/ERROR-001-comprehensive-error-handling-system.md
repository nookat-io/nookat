# [ERROR-001] Implement comprehensive error handling system

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive error handling system that provides consistent error management, user-friendly error messages, and proper error recovery mechanisms across the entire application.

## Description

The current application has inconsistent error handling with basic try-catch blocks and generic error messages. We need to implement a robust error handling system that categorizes errors, provides meaningful user feedback, and includes proper error recovery mechanisms for different types of failures.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement error categorization and classification system
- Create user-friendly error message templates
- Add error boundary components for React error handling
- Implement error logging and reporting system
- Create error recovery mechanisms and retry logic
- Add error state management and persistence

### Backend

- Implement structured error handling for all API calls
- Create error categorization and mapping system
- Add error logging and monitoring capabilities
- Implement error recovery strategies for different failure types
- Create error reporting and analytics system
- Add error context preservation and debugging information

### Data Flow

1. Error occurs in application (API, UI, system)
2. Error is categorized and logged with context
3. User-friendly error message is generated
4. Error is displayed to user with recovery options
5. Error analytics are collected for monitoring
6. Recovery mechanisms are triggered when appropriate

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] All API errors are properly caught and handled
- [ ] User-friendly error messages for all error types
- [ ] Error categorization (network, Docker, system, user)
- [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms for transient errors
- [ ] Error boundaries prevent application crashes
- [ ] Error logging and reporting system working
- [ ] Error recovery options available to users

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Error messages appear within 200ms of error occurrence
- [ ] Error handling doesn't impact application performance
- [ ] Error logs are properly structured and searchable
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms are reliable
- [ ] Error reporting doesn't expose sensitive information

### User Experience

- [ ] Clear, actionable error messages
- [ ] Consistent error UI across all pages
- [ ] Helpful recovery suggestions for common errors
- [ ] No application crashes due to unhandled errors
- [ ] Professional error presentation

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Error categorization system
// Structured error logging
// Error recovery strategies
// Error reporting and analytics
// Context preservation
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Error boundary components
// Error state management
// User-friendly error messages
// Error recovery mechanisms
// Error logging and reporting
```

## Dependencies

- Error boundary library for React
- Error logging and monitoring service
- Error categorization framework
- Error recovery strategy library
- Error reporting and analytics tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Comprehensive error handling implemented
- [ ] All error types properly categorized
- [ ] User-friendly error messages working
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms functional
- [ ] Error logging and reporting operational
- [ ] Error boundaries prevent crashes
- [ ] Tests written for error handling
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing error telemetry for monitoring
- Ensure error messages are accessible and localized
- Test error handling with various failure scenarios
- Implement graceful degradation for critical errors
