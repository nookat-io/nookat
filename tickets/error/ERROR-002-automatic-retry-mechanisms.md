# [ERROR-002] Add automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Overview

Implement intelligent automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations to improve application reliability and reduce user frustration from transient failures.

## Description

Currently, when operations fail, users must manually retry them. We need to implement automatic retry mechanisms that intelligently handle transient failures (network issues, temporary Docker daemon unavailability, etc.) while providing clear feedback to users about retry attempts and avoiding infinite retry loops.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement retry logic for failed API calls
- Add exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Create retry attempt indicators and progress feedback
- Implement retry limits and failure escalation
- Add user controls for retry behavior
- Create retry state management and persistence

### Backend

- Implement retry mechanisms for Docker API calls
- Add intelligent retry strategies based on error types
- Create retry attempt tracking and logging
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
- Add retry configuration and customization options
- Create retry analytics and monitoring

### Data Flow

1. Operation fails with retryable error
2. Retry mechanism evaluates error type and context
3. Automatic retry is attempted with exponential backoff
4. User is informed of retry attempts and progress
5. After retry limit, operation is marked as failed
6. User is provided with manual retry options

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Automatic retry for network-related failures
- [ ] Automatic retry for temporary Docker daemon issues
- [ ] Exponential backoff between retry attempts
- [ ] Configurable retry limits (default: 3 attempts)
- [ ] User feedback for retry attempts and progress
- [ ] Manual retry option after automatic retries fail
- [ ] Retry state persistence across application restarts

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Retry attempts don't exceed 30 seconds total
- [ ] Retry mechanism doesn't impact UI responsiveness
- [ ] Retry attempts are properly logged and monitored
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents infinite retry loops
- [ ] Retry configuration is customizable per operation type

### User Experience

- [ ] Clear indication when retries are happening
- [ ] Progress feedback for retry attempts
- [ ] Option to cancel ongoing retry attempts
- [ ] Helpful error messages after retry failures
- [ ] Consistent retry behavior across all operations

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Retry logic implementation
// Exponential backoff algorithm
// Circuit breaker pattern
// Retry attempt tracking
// Error type classification
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Retry state management
// Progress indicators
// User feedback components
// Retry configuration
// Manual retry controls
```

## Dependencies

- Retry library for exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Progress tracking components
- State management for retry logic
- Error classification system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Exponential backoff working correctly
- [ ] Retry limits and circuit breaker functional
- [ ] User feedback for retry attempts working
- [ ] Manual retry options available
- [ ] Retry state persistence implemented
- [ ] Tests written for retry mechanisms
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Monitor retry success rates to optimize retry strategies
- Consider implementing different retry strategies for different operation types
- Ensure retry mechanisms don't interfere with real-time updates
- Test retry behavior with various network conditions
