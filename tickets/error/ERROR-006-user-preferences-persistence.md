# [ERROR-006] Implement user preferences persistence

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive user preferences persistence system that saves and restores user-specific settings, UI preferences, and application behavior across sessions.

## Description

Users currently lose their preferences (theme, layout, default settings, etc.) when the application restarts. We need to implement a user preferences system that remembers user choices and provides a personalized experience across application sessions.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement user preferences management system
- Create preference persistence and retrieval
- Add preference validation and defaults
- Implement preference synchronization across components
- Create preference reset and migration functionality
- Add preference export and import capabilities

### Backend

- Implement secure preference storage
- Create preference encryption for sensitive data
- Add preference validation and integrity checking
- Implement preference migration and versioning
- Create preference analytics and usage tracking
- Add preference backup and recovery mechanisms

### Data Flow

1. User modifies a preference setting
2. Preference is validated and stored locally
3. Preference change is synchronized across components
4. Preference is persisted to secure storage
5. Preference is restored on application startup
6. Application applies user preferences

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Theme preferences persist across sessions
- [ ] Layout and UI preferences are saved and restored
- [ ] Default settings and behaviors are customizable
- [ ] Preference validation prevents invalid settings
- [ ] Preference migration handles version updates
- [ ] Preference export and import functionality
- [ ] Preference reset to defaults option

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Preference persistence doesn't impact application startup
- [ ] Preference data is properly secured and encrypted
- [ ] Preference validation completes within 50ms
- [ ] Preference storage supports up to 5MB of data
- [ ] Preference synchronization works across all components

### User Experience

- [ ] Seamless preference persistence across sessions
- [ ] Personalized application experience
- [ ] Easy access to preference settings
- [ ] Clear feedback for preference changes
- [ ] Consistent behavior based on user preferences

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Preference storage management
// Preference encryption
// Preference validation
// Migration and versioning
// Analytics and tracking
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Preference management system
// Preference persistence
// Preference synchronization
// Preference validation
// Export and import functionality
```

## Dependencies

- Secure storage library for preferences
- Encryption library for sensitive preferences
- Preference validation framework
- Migration and versioning system
- Analytics and tracking tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User preferences persistence system implemented
- [ ] All preference types persist across sessions
- [ ] Preference validation and migration working
- [ ] Preference export and import functional
- [ ] Sensitive preferences properly encrypted
- [ ] Preference synchronization across components
- [ ] Tests written for preference system
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing preference profiles for different use cases
- Ensure preference storage doesn't impact application performance
- Test preference migration with various data formats
- Monitor preference usage patterns for optimization
