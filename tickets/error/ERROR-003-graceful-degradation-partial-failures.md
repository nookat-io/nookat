# [ERROR-003] Implement graceful degradation for partial failures

## Overview

Implement graceful degradation mechanisms to handle partial failures where some features work while others fail, ensuring the application remains functional and provides a good user experience.

## Description

Currently, when parts of the application fail (e.g., container operations work but image operations fail), the entire application may become unusable or provide a poor user experience. We need to implement graceful degradation that allows users to continue using working features while clearly indicating which features are unavailable.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement feature availability detection
- Create fallback UI for unavailable features
- Add feature status indicators and notifications
- Implement partial data loading and display
- Create graceful error boundaries for component failures
- Add feature toggle mechanisms for degraded mode

### Backend

- Implement service health monitoring
- Create feature availability checking mechanisms
- Add partial data retrieval capabilities
- Implement service isolation and failure containment
- Create health check endpoints for different services
- Add service dependency mapping and failure propagation

### Data Flow

1. Application detects partial service failures
2. Available features are identified and marked
3. UI adapts to show only working features
4. Users are informed about unavailable features
5. Fallback mechanisms provide alternative functionality
6. Health monitoring continuously checks service status

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Application continues working when some services fail
- [ ] Users can access working features while others are down
- [ ] Clear indication of which features are unavailable
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for critical features
- [ ] Service health monitoring and status reporting
- [ ] Automatic recovery when services become available
- [ ] Feature-specific error boundaries and isolation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Application startup time < 5 seconds even with partial failures
- [ ] UI responsiveness maintained during degraded mode
- [ ] Service health checks complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] Graceful degradation doesn't impact working features
- [ ] Recovery time < 10 seconds when services become available

### User Experience

- [ ] Clear indication of application status and available features
- [ ] Helpful messaging about unavailable features
- [ ] Alternative workflows for common tasks
- [ ] No application crashes due to partial failures
- [ ] Smooth transitions between normal and degraded modes

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Service health monitoring
// Feature availability checking
// Partial data retrieval
// Service isolation mechanisms
// Health check endpoints
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Feature availability detection
// Graceful error boundaries
// Fallback UI components
// Service status indicators
// Feature toggle mechanisms
```

## Dependencies

- Health check monitoring library
- Service discovery framework
- Error boundary components
- Feature flag management system
- Service status monitoring tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Graceful degradation implemented for all features
- [ ] Service health monitoring working
- [ ] Feature availability detection functional
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for critical features
- [ ] Clear user feedback for unavailable features
- [ ] Automatic recovery mechanisms working
- [ ] Tests written for degradation scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing feature flags for easier testing
- Monitor service dependencies to optimize degradation strategies
- Ensure graceful degradation doesn't hide critical errors
- Test with various partial failure scenarios
