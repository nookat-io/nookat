# [ERROR-008] Implement backup and restore functionality

## Overview

Implement comprehensive backup and restore functionality to protect user data, configurations, and application state, enabling users to recover from data loss or corruption.

## Description

The application currently has no backup and restore capabilities, leaving users vulnerable to data loss from system failures, corruption, or accidental deletion. We need to implement a robust backup and restore system that protects user data and provides reliable recovery mechanisms.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement backup creation and management interface
- Create restore functionality with data validation
- Add backup scheduling and automation
- Implement backup encryption and security
- Create backup verification and integrity checking
- Add backup history and management

### Backend

- Implement secure backup storage and encryption
- Create backup compression and optimization
- Add backup verification and integrity checking
- Implement backup scheduling and automation
- Create backup recovery and restoration mechanisms
- Add backup monitoring and analytics

### Data Flow

1. User initiates backup or scheduled backup runs
2. Application data is collected and validated
3. Data is encrypted and compressed
4. Backup is stored securely with metadata
5. Backup integrity is verified
6. User can restore from backup when needed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Manual backup creation and management
- [ ] Automated backup scheduling
- [ ] Secure backup encryption and storage
- [ ] Backup verification and integrity checking
- [ ] Restore functionality with data validation
- [ ] Backup history and management interface
- [ ] Backup compression and optimization

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Backup creation completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Backup restoration completes within 60 seconds
- [ ] Backup data is properly encrypted and secured
- [ ] Backup verification completes within 10 seconds
- [ ] Backup storage supports up to 1GB of data

### User Experience

- [ ] Easy backup creation and management
- [ ] Clear backup status and progress indicators
- [ ] Intuitive restore process with validation
- [ ] Helpful backup history and management
- [ ] Professional backup and restore interface

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Backup creation and storage

## Dependencies

- Backup and restore library
- Encryption library for backup security
- Compression library for backup optimization
- Scheduling library for automated backups
- Verification and integrity checking tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Backup and restore system implemented
- [ ] Manual and automated backup creation working
- [ ] Backup encryption and security functional
- [ ] Restore functionality with validation
- [ ] Backup verification and integrity checking
- [ ] Backup history and management
- [ ] Tests written for backup and restore
