# [CONTAINER-000] Create GUI-based container creation wizard (select image from the GUI)

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive GUI-based container creation wizard that allows users to create containers by selecting images from a visual interface, with step-by-step configuration options.

## Description

Currently, users need to use command-line tools to create containers. We need to implement a user-friendly GUI wizard that guides users through container creation by selecting images from a visual interface and configuring all necessary settings through an intuitive step-by-step process.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement container creation wizard interface
- Create image selection and browsing interface
- Add step-by-step configuration forms
- Implement configuration validation and preview
- Create wizard progress tracking
- Add wizard help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement container creation API endpoints
- Create image listing and search functionality
- Add container configuration validation
- Implement container creation execution
- Create container creation monitoring
- Add container creation analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User opens container creation wizard
2. User selects base image from visual interface
3. User configures container settings step by step
4. Configuration is validated and previewed
5. Container is created with specified settings
6. User receives confirmation and container details
