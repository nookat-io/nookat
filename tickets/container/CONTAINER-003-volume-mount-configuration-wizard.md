# [CONTAINER-003] Add volume mount configuration wizard

## Overview

Implement a volume mount configuration wizard that allows users to configure and manage volume mounts for containers through a visual interface with validation and preview capabilities.

## Description

Users need to configure volume mounts for containers with proper validation and management capabilities. We need to implement a wizard that allows users to configure volume mounts, bind mounts, and named volumes through a visual interface with path validation and preview functionality.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement volume mount configuration wizard
- Create volume mount validation and preview
- Add volume mount templates and presets
- Implement volume mount path selection
- Create volume mount type selection
- Add volume mount help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement volume mount validation
- Create volume mount path checking
- Add volume mount configuration parsing
- Implement volume mount security validation
- Create volume mount templates and presets
- Add volume mount analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User opens volume mount configuration wizard
2. User selects volume mount type and source
3. Volume mount is validated and previewed
4. User configures mount options and permissions
5. Volume mount is applied to container configuration
6. User receives validation feedback and confirmation
