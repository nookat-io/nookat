# [CONTAINER-005] Implement port mapping configuration

## Overview

Implement a port mapping configuration interface that allows users to configure and manage port mappings for containers through a visual interface with validation and conflict detection.

## Description

Users need to configure port mappings for containers with proper validation and conflict detection capabilities. We need to implement an interface that allows users to configure port mappings, detect conflicts, and manage port allocation through a visual interface.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement port mapping configuration interface
- Create port conflict detection and resolution
- Add port mapping validation and testing
- Implement port allocation and management
- Create port mapping templates and presets
- Add port mapping help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement port mapping validation
- Create port conflict detection
- Add port allocation and management
- Implement port mapping testing
- Create port mapping templates and presets
- Add port mapping analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User opens port mapping configuration interface
2. User configures port mappings and settings
3. Port mappings are validated and conflicts detected
4. User resolves conflicts and finalizes configuration
5. Port mappings are applied to container configuration
6. User receives validation feedback and confirmation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Port mapping configuration interface
- [ ] Port conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Port mapping validation and testing
- [ ] Port allocation and management
- [ ] Port mapping templates and presets
- [ ] Port mapping security validation
- [ ] Port mapping help and documentation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Interface loads within 500ms
- [ ] Port validation completes within 200ms
- [ ] Conflict detection completes within 300ms
- [ ] Port testing completes within 1 second
- [ ] Interface works across all supported platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive port mapping configuration
- [ ] Clear conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Helpful port mapping templates
- [ ] Professional interface appearance
- [ ] Seamless port mapping configuration

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Port mapping validation
// Port conflict detection
// Port allocation and management
// Port mapping testing
// Templates and presets
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Port mapping configuration interface
// Conflict detection and resolution
// Validation and testing
// Allocation and management
// Templates and presets
```

## Dependencies

- Port mapping validation library
- Conflict detection framework
- Port allocation utilities
- Testing and validation system
- Template management framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Port mapping configuration interface implemented
- [ ] Port conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Port mapping validation and testing
- [ ] Port allocation and management
- [ ] Port mapping templates and presets
- [ ] Port mapping security validation
- [ ] Tests written for port mapping configuration
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing port autocomplete
- Ensure interface supports various port types
- Test interface with complex port configurations
- Monitor port mapping usage patterns and optimize
