# [CONTAINER-004] Create network assignment interface

## Overview

Implement a network assignment interface that allows users to configure and manage network settings for containers through a visual interface with network discovery and validation.

## Description

Users need to configure network settings for containers with proper validation and management capabilities. We need to implement an interface that allows users to assign containers to networks, configure network settings, and manage network connectivity through a visual interface.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement network assignment interface
- Create network discovery and listing
- Add network configuration and settings
- Implement network validation and testing
- Create network templates and presets
- Add network help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement network discovery and listing
- Create network configuration validation
- Add network connectivity testing
- Implement network security validation
- Create network templates and presets
- Add network analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User opens network assignment interface
2. Available networks are discovered and listed
3. User selects network and configures settings
4. Network configuration is validated and tested
5. Network is assigned to container configuration
6. User receives validation feedback and confirmation
