# [CONTAINER-002] Implement environment variable management interface

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive environment variable management interface that allows users to configure, validate, and manage environment variables for containers through a user-friendly interface.

## Description

Users need to configure environment variables for containers with proper validation and management capabilities. We need to implement a visual interface that allows users to add, edit, validate, and manage environment variables with support for different variable types and validation rules.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement environment variable editor interface
- Create variable validation and type checking
- Add variable templates and presets
- Implement variable import and export
- Create variable search and filtering
- Add variable help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement environment variable validation
- Create variable type checking and parsing
- Add variable import and export functionality
- Implement variable security and encryption
- Create variable templates and presets
- Add variable analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User opens environment variable management interface
2. User adds or imports environment variables
3. Variables are validated and type checked
4. User configures variable settings and security
5. Variables are applied to container configuration
6. User receives validation feedback and confirmation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Environment variable editor interface
- [ ] Variable validation and type checking
- [ ] Variable templates and presets
- [ ] Variable import and export
- [ ] Variable search and filtering
- [ ] Variable security and encryption
- [ ] Variable help and documentation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Variable editor loads within 500ms
- [ ] Variable validation completes within 100ms
- [ ] Variable import/export works reliably
- [ ] Variable security encryption functional
- [ ] Interface works across all supported platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive variable management interface
- [ ] Clear validation feedback
- [ ] Helpful variable templates
- [ ] Professional interface appearance
- [ ] Seamless variable configuration

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Environment variable validation
// Variable type checking and parsing
// Import and export functionality
// Security and encryption
// Templates and presets
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Environment variable editor
// Validation and type checking
// Templates and presets
// Import and export
// Search and filtering
```

## Dependencies

- Environment variable validation library
- Variable type checking framework
- Import and export utilities
- Security and encryption system
- Template management framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Environment variable management interface implemented
- [ ] Variable validation and type checking
- [ ] Variable templates and presets
- [ ] Variable import and export
- [ ] Variable search and filtering
- [ ] Variable security and encryption
- [ ] Tests written for environment variable management
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing variable autocomplete
- Ensure interface supports various variable types
- Test interface with complex variable configurations
- Monitor variable usage patterns and optimize
