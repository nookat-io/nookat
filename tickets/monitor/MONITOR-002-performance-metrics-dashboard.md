# [MONITOR-002] Create performance metrics dashboard

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive performance metrics dashboard that provides an overview of container performance, system health, and key performance indicators with customizable widgets and real-time updates.

## Description

Users need a centralized dashboard to monitor container performance, system health, and key metrics at a glance. We need to implement a customizable dashboard with performance widgets, real-time updates, and comprehensive metrics display.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement performance metrics dashboard
- Create customizable dashboard widgets
- Add real-time metrics display
- Implement dashboard layout management
- Create performance alerts and notifications
- Add dashboard export and sharing

### Backend

- Implement performance metrics collection
- Create metrics aggregation and processing
- Add dashboard configuration management
- Implement performance alerting system
- Create metrics storage and retrieval
- Add dashboard analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. Performance metrics are collected from containers
2. Metrics are aggregated and processed for dashboard
3. Dashboard widgets are updated with real-time data
4. Performance alerts are triggered based on thresholds
5. Dashboard configuration is saved and restored
6. Users can customize and share dashboard layouts
