# [MONITOR-003] Add container health checks

## Overview

Implement comprehensive container health checks that monitor container status, application health, and provide automated health assessment with alerts and reporting.

## Description

Users need to monitor container health and application status to ensure containers are running properly. We need to implement health checks that monitor container status, application responsiveness, and provide automated health assessment with detailed reporting.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement container health check interface
- Create health status indicators and alerts
- Add health check configuration and management
- Implement health check history and reporting
- Create health check customization options
- Add health check help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement container health check execution
- Create health check configuration management
- Add health check result processing
- Implement health check alerting system
- Create health check history and storage
- Add health check analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. Health checks are configured for containers
2. Health checks are executed at scheduled intervals
3. Health check results are processed and analyzed
4. Health status is updated and displayed
5. Alerts are triggered for failed health checks
6. Health check history is stored and reported
