# [MONITOR-001] Implement real-time resource usage graphs (CPU, Memory, Network, Disk)

## Overview

Implement comprehensive real-time resource usage graphs that display CPU, Memory, Network, and Disk usage for containers with interactive charts and detailed analytics.

## Description

Users need to monitor container resource usage in real-time to understand performance and identify bottlenecks. We need to implement interactive graphs that display CPU, Memory, Network, and Disk usage with real-time updates, historical data, and detailed analytics.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement real-time resource usage graphs
- Create interactive chart components
- Add resource usage filtering and zooming
- Implement historical data display
- Create resource usage alerts and thresholds
- Add resource usage export and reporting

### Backend

- Implement real-time resource data collection
- Create resource usage data processing
- Add resource usage analytics and aggregation
- Implement resource usage storage and retrieval
- Create resource usage alerting system
- Add resource usage reporting and analytics

### Data Flow

1. Container resource usage data is collected in real-time
2. Data is processed and aggregated for display
3. Real-time graphs are updated with current data
4. Historical data is stored and retrieved
5. Alerts are triggered based on thresholds
6. Users can interact with graphs and export data

## Acceptance Criteria
