# [MONITOR-004] Implement log aggregation and filtering

## Overview

Implement comprehensive log aggregation and filtering system that collects, processes, and displays container logs with advanced filtering, search, and analysis capabilities.

## Description

Users need to aggregate and filter container logs to monitor application behavior and troubleshoot issues. We need to implement a log aggregation system that collects logs from multiple containers, provides advanced filtering and search capabilities, and offers real-time log analysis.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement log aggregation interface
- Create log filtering and search capabilities
- Add real-time log streaming
- Implement log analysis and visualization
- Create log export and reporting
- Add log configuration and management

### Backend

- Implement log collection and aggregation
- Create log filtering and processing
- Add log search and indexing
- Implement log storage and retrieval
- Create log analytics and reporting
- Add log configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Container logs are collected and aggregated
2. Logs are processed and indexed for search
3. Log filtering and search queries are executed
4. Filtered logs are displayed in real-time
5. Log analytics and insights are generated
6. Users can export and report on logs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Log aggregation interface
- [ ] Log filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Real-time log streaming
- [ ] Log analysis and visualization
- [ ] Log export and reporting
- [ ] Log configuration and management
- [ ] Log search and indexing

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Log aggregation processes logs within 1 second
- [ ] Log search completes within 500ms
