# [TRAY-004] Implement background monitoring capabilities

## Overview

Implement comprehensive background monitoring capabilities that allow the application to monitor Docker resources and events even when minimized to the system tray.

## Description

Users need the application to continue monitoring Docker resources and events when minimized to the system tray. We need to implement background monitoring that provides real-time updates, alerts, and status tracking without requiring the application to be in the foreground.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement background monitoring status display
- Create background monitoring configuration
- Add background monitoring alerts and notifications
- Implement background monitoring controls
- Create background monitoring status indicators
- Add background monitoring preferences and settings

### Backend

- Implement background monitoring system
- Create background resource monitoring
- Add background event detection and processing
- Implement background monitoring analytics
- Create background monitoring configuration
- Add background monitoring health checks

### Data Flow

1. Application is minimized to system tray
2. Background monitoring system activates
3. Docker resources and events are monitored
4. Important events trigger notifications
5. Monitoring data is collected and analyzed
6. User receives alerts and status updates

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Background monitoring of Docker resources
- [ ] Background event detection and processing
- [ ] Background monitoring alerts and notifications
- [ ] Background monitoring configuration
- [ ] Background monitoring status tracking
- [ ] Background monitoring analytics and reporting
- [ ] Background monitoring health checks

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Background monitoring uses minimal system resources
- [ ] Background monitoring doesn't impact system performance
- [ ] Background monitoring provides real-time updates
- [ ] Background monitoring supports all Docker resource types
- [ ] Background monitoring works reliably across platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Seamless background monitoring experience
- [ ] Clear background monitoring status
- [ ] Helpful background monitoring alerts
- [ ] Professional background monitoring interface
- [ ] Intuitive background monitoring controls

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Background monitoring system
// Resource monitoring
// Event detection and processing
// Analytics and reporting
// Health checks
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Background monitoring interface
// Status display and controls
// Alerts and notifications
// Configuration and preferences
// Status indicators
```

## Dependencies

- Background monitoring framework
- Resource monitoring library
- Event detection and processing system
- Analytics and reporting tools
- Health check monitoring utilities

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Background monitoring system implemented
- [ ] Background resource monitoring working
- [ ] Background event detection functional
- [ ] Background monitoring alerts operational
- [ ] Background monitoring configuration
- [ ] Background monitoring analytics
- [ ] Tests written for background monitoring
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing monitoring resource limits
- Ensure background monitoring doesn't drain battery
- Test background monitoring with various system configurations
- Monitor background monitoring performance and resource usage
