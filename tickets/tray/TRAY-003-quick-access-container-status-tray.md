# [TRAY-003] Create quick access to container status from tray

## Overview

Implement quick access to container status and information directly from the system tray, allowing users to monitor containers without opening the full application.

## Description

Users need to quickly check container status and basic information without opening the full application. We need to implement a system tray menu that provides quick access to container status, basic information, and common actions directly from the tray.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement tray container status display
- Create tray container list and information
- Add tray container action shortcuts
- Implement tray container status indicators
- Create tray container search and filtering
- Add tray container refresh functionality

### Backend

- Implement tray container status monitoring
- Create tray container data caching
- Add tray container action processing
- Implement tray container status updates
- Create tray container analytics and reporting
- Add tray container configuration and settings

### Data Flow

1. User opens tray container status menu
2. Container status data is retrieved and cached
3. Container list is displayed with status indicators
4. User can view container details and perform actions
5. Container status is updated in real-time
6. Container actions are processed and applied
