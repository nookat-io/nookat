# [TRAY-002] Add system tray notifications and alerts

## Overview

Implement comprehensive system tray notification and alert system to keep users informed about important Docker events and application status changes.

## Description

Users need to be notified about important Docker events (container status changes, build completions, errors) even when the application is minimized. We need to implement a system tray notification system that provides timely, relevant alerts without being intrusive.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement system tray notification system
- Create notification templates and styling
- Add notification priority and categorization
- Implement notification history and management
- Create notification preferences and settings
- Add notification action handling

### Backend

- Implement notification event detection and processing
- Create notification priority and filtering system
- Add notification delivery and queuing
- Implement notification history and persistence
- Create notification analytics and reporting
- Add notification configuration and settings

### Data Flow

1. Docker event or application status change occurs
2. Event is processed and categorized for notification
3. Notification is created with appropriate priority
4. Notification is delivered to system tray
5. User can interact with notification
6. Notification history is maintained
