# [TRAY-001] Implement application minimization to system tray

## Overview

Implement system tray integration that allows users to minimize the application to the system tray, providing background operation capabilities while keeping the application accessible.

## Description

Currently, the application can only be minimized to the taskbar/dock. We need to implement system tray functionality that allows users to minimize the application to the system tray, enabling background operation while maintaining easy access to the application.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement system tray icon and menu
- Create minimize to tray functionality
- Add tray icon status indicators
- Implement tray menu with common actions
- Create tray notification system
- Add tray icon customization options

### Backend

- Implement system tray management
- Create tray icon creation and management
- Add tray menu functionality
- Implement tray notification system
- Create tray status monitoring
- Add tray configuration and settings

### Data Flow

1. User minimizes application to system tray
2. Application window is hidden from taskbar/dock
3. System tray icon is created and displayed
4. Tray menu provides access to common actions
5. Application continues running in background
6. User can restore application from tray

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Application minimizes to system tray
- [ ] System tray icon displays application status
- [ ] Tray menu provides common actions
- [ ] Tray notifications work for important events
- [ ] Application can be restored from tray
- [ ] Tray icon customization options
- [ ] Tray status monitoring and updates

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Minimize to tray completes within 500ms
