# [DEBUG-007] Implement error log analysis

## Overview

Implement comprehensive error log analysis that provides detailed analysis, categorization, and insights from container and application logs.

## Description

Users need to analyze error logs to identify patterns, troubleshoot issues, and improve application reliability. We need to implement error log analysis that provides log parsing, error categorization, pattern recognition, and actionable insights.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement error log analysis interface
- Create log parsing and visualization
- Add error categorization and filtering
- Implement pattern recognition and analysis
- Create error trend analysis and reporting
- Add log search and filtering capabilities

### Backend

- Implement error log analysis logic
- Create log parsing and processing
- Add error categorization algorithms
- Implement pattern recognition engine
- Create error trend analysis
- Add log analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. Error logs are collected and parsed
2. Errors are categorized and analyzed
3. Patterns are identified and recognized
4. Error trends are analyzed and reported
5. Insights and recommendations are generated
6. Analysis results are displayed and stored

## Acceptance Criteria
