# [DEBUG-004] Implement performance profiling tools

## Overview

Implement comprehensive performance profiling tools that allow users to analyze container performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource usage.

## Description

Users need to profile and analyze performance of their Docker containers to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage. We need to implement performance profiling tools that provide detailed performance analysis, resource monitoring, and optimization recommendations.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement performance profiling interface
- Create performance metrics visualization
- Add bottleneck identification and analysis
- Implement performance comparison tools
- Create optimization recommendations
- Add performance profiling history and reporting

### Backend

- Implement performance profiling logic
- Create performance metrics collection
- Add bottleneck detection and analysis
- Implement performance comparison algorithms
- Create optimization recommendation engine
- Add performance profiling analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User initiates performance profiling
2. Performance metrics are collected and analyzed
3. Bottlenecks are identified and categorized
4. Performance comparisons are performed
5. Optimization recommendations are generated
6. Profiling results are reported and stored
