# [DEBUG-006] Add resource usage alerts

## Overview

Implement comprehensive resource usage alerts that monitor container resource consumption and provide timely notifications for resource-related issues.

## Description

Users need to monitor resource usage and receive alerts when containers approach or exceed resource limits. We need to implement resource usage alerts that provide real-time monitoring, threshold-based notifications, and resource optimization recommendations.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement resource usage alerts interface
- Create alert configuration and management
- Add real-time resource monitoring
- Implement alert notifications and display
- Create alert history and reporting
- Add resource optimization suggestions

### Backend

- Implement resource usage alert logic
- Create resource monitoring and tracking
- Add alert threshold management
- Implement alert notification system
- Create alert analytics and reporting
- Add resource optimization recommendations

### Data Flow

1. Resource usage is monitored in real-time
2. Resource consumption is compared to thresholds
3. Alerts are triggered when thresholds are exceeded
4. Notifications are sent and displayed
5. Alert history is logged and tracked
6. Resource optimization recommendations are generated

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Resource usage alerts interface
- [ ] Alert configuration and management
- [ ] Real-time resource monitoring
- [ ] Alert notifications and display
- [ ] Alert history and reporting
- [ ] Resource optimization suggestions
- [ ] Support for multiple resource types

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Resource alerts respond within 1 second
- [ ] Alert notifications display within 500ms
- [ ] Resource monitoring updates within 2 seconds
- [ ] Resource usage alerts work across all platforms
- [ ] Alert system handles high-frequency updates

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive resource usage alerts interface
- [ ] Clear alert configuration and management
- [ ] Helpful real-time resource monitoring
- [ ] Professional alert notifications and display
- [ ] Seamless resource alert workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Resource usage alert logic
// Resource monitoring and tracking
// Alert threshold management
// Alert notification system
// Alert analytics and reporting
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Resource usage alerts interface
// Alert configuration and management
// Real-time resource monitoring
// Alert notifications and display
// Alert history and reporting
```

## Dependencies

- Resource monitoring library
- Alert management framework
- Notification system utilities
- Resource optimization tools
- Alert analytics and reporting framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Resource usage alerts implemented
- [ ] Alert configuration and management working
- [ ] Real-time resource monitoring functional
- [ ] Alert notifications and display operational
- [ ] Alert history and reporting
- [ ] Support for multiple resource types
- [ ] Tests written for resource usage alerts
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing predictive resource alerts
- Ensure alerts work with various resource types
- Test alerts with different threshold scenarios
- Monitor resource alert performance and optimize
