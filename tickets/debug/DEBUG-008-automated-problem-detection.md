# [DEBUG-008] Create automated problem detection

## Overview

Implement automated problem detection that continuously monitors containers and applications to identify issues before they become critical problems.

## Description

Users need automated problem detection to proactively identify and address issues in their Docker environments. We need to implement automated problem detection that provides continuous monitoring, intelligent issue identification, and proactive alerting.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement automated problem detection interface
- Create problem detection dashboard
- Add alert configuration and management
- Implement problem categorization and prioritization
- Create automated response suggestions
- Add detection history and reporting

### Backend

- Implement automated problem detection logic
- Create continuous monitoring system
- Add intelligent issue identification algorithms
- Implement problem categorization and prioritization
- Create automated response engine
- Add detection analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. Continuous monitoring collects system data
2. Intelligent algorithms analyze data for issues
3. Problems are detected and categorized
4. Alerts are generated and prioritized
5. Automated responses are suggested
6. Detection results are reported and stored
