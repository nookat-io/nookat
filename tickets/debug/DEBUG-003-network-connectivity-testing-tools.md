# [DEBUG-003] Add network connectivity testing tools

## Overview

Implement comprehensive network connectivity testing tools that allow users to diagnose network issues, test connectivity, and troubleshoot network problems within Docker environments.

## Description

Users need to test and diagnose network connectivity issues in their Docker environments. We need to implement network connectivity testing tools that provide ping, traceroute, DNS resolution, and other network diagnostic capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement network connectivity testing interface
- Create ping and traceroute tools
- Add DNS resolution testing
- Implement port scanning and testing
- Create network diagnostic reporting
- Add connectivity test history and logging

### Backend

- Implement network connectivity testing logic
- Create ping and traceroute functionality
- Add DNS resolution and testing
- Implement port scanning and testing
- Create network diagnostic analytics
- Add connectivity test configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User initiates network connectivity test
2. Test parameters are configured and validated
3. Network tests are executed and monitored
4. Test results are analyzed and displayed
5. Diagnostic information is generated
6. Test history is logged and reported

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Network connectivity testing interface
- [ ] Ping and traceroute tools
- [ ] DNS resolution testing
- [ ] Port scanning and testing
- [ ] Network diagnostic reporting
- [ ] Connectivity test history and logging
- [ ] Support for multiple network protocols

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Network testing interface loads within 1 second
- [ ] Ping tests complete within 5 seconds
