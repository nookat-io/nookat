# [DEBUG-001] Implement process monitoring within containers

## Overview

Implement comprehensive process monitoring within containers that allows users to view, analyze, and manage running processes inside Docker containers.

## Description

Users need to monitor and manage processes running inside Docker containers for debugging and troubleshooting. We need to implement process monitoring that provides real-time process information, resource usage, and process management capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement process monitoring interface
- Create real-time process information display
- Add process resource usage visualization
- Implement process management and control
- Create process filtering and search
- Add process history and logging

### Backend

- Implement process monitoring logic
- Create process data collection and analysis
- Add process resource usage tracking
- Implement process management operations
- Create process analytics and reporting
- Add process monitoring configuration

### Data Flow

1. User selects container for process monitoring
2. Process data is collected in real-time
3. Process information is analyzed and displayed
4. Resource usage is tracked and visualized
5. Process management operations are executed
6. Process monitoring results are reported

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Process monitoring interface
- [ ] Real-time process information display
- [ ] Process resource usage visualization
- [ ] Process management and control
- [ ] Process filtering and search
- [ ] Process history and logging
- [ ] Support for multiple process types

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Process monitoring loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Real-time updates occur within 1 second
- [ ] Process management responds within 500ms
- [ ] Process monitoring works with large process lists
- [ ] Process monitoring works across all platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive process monitoring interface
- [ ] Clear process information display
- [ ] Helpful process management controls
- [ ] Professional process monitoring workflow
- [ ] Seamless process monitoring experience

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Process monitoring logic
// Process data collection and analysis

```

## Dependencies

- Process monitoring library
- Process data collection framework
- Resource usage tracking utilities
- Process management tools
- Process analytics and reporting framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Process monitoring within containers implemented
