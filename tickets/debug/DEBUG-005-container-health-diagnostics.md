# [DEBUG-005] Create container health diagnostics

## Overview

Implement comprehensive container health diagnostics that provide detailed health assessment, issue detection, and recovery recommendations for Docker containers.

## Description

Users need to diagnose and assess the health of their Docker containers to identify issues and ensure optimal performance. We need to implement container health diagnostics that provide comprehensive health assessment, issue detection, and recovery recommendations.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement container health diagnostics interface
- Create health assessment and scoring
- Add issue detection and categorization
- Implement recovery recommendations
- Create health monitoring and alerts
- Add diagnostic history and reporting

### Backend

- Implement container health diagnostics logic
- Create health assessment algorithms
- Add issue detection and analysis
- Implement recovery recommendation engine
- Create health monitoring and alerting
- Add diagnostic analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User initiates container health diagnostics
2. Health assessment is performed and scored
3. Issues are detected and categorized
4. Recovery recommendations are generated
5. Health monitoring is configured
6. Diagnostic results are reported and stored

## Acceptance Criteria
