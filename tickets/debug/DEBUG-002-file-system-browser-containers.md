# [DEBUG-002] Create file system browser for containers

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive file system browser that allows users to navigate, view, and manage files within Docker containers with advanced file operations.

## Description

Users need to browse and manage files within Docker containers for debugging and file management. We need to implement a file system browser that provides file navigation, viewing, editing, and management capabilities within containers.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement file system browser interface
- Create file navigation and directory tree
- Add file viewing and editing capabilities
- Implement file operations (copy, move, delete)
- Create file search and filtering
- Add file permissions and attributes display

### Backend

- Implement file system browser logic
- Create file system navigation and access
- Add file operations and management
- Implement file viewing and editing
- Create file search and indexing
- Add file system analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User accesses file system browser for container
2. File system structure is loaded and displayed
3. User navigates through directories and files
4. File operations are executed and validated
5. File content is viewed or edited
6. File system changes are tracked and reported

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] File system browser interface
- [ ] File navigation and directory tree
- [ ] File viewing and editing capabilities
- [ ] File operations (copy, move, delete)
- [ ] File search and filtering
- [ ] File permissions and attributes display
- [ ] Support for multiple file types

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] File system browser loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] File navigation responds within 500ms
- [ ] File operations complete within 1 second
