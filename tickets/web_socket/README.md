# WebSocket Implementation - DIST-013

## Overview

Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates using the Tauri WebSocket plugin to provide live container status changes, resource usage updates, and system events without requiring manual refresh or polling.

## Description

Currently, the application relies on periodic polling to update container status and system information. This approach is inefficient and doesn't provide real-time feedback to users. We need to implement WebSocket connections using Tauri's official WebSocket plugin to enable live updates for container state changes, resource usage, and system events.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Tauri WebSocket Plugin Integration

- [Task 1.1](task-1.1-plugin-installation.md) - Plugin Installation and Configuration
- [Task 1.2](task-1.2-backend-websocket-server.md) - Backend WebSocket Server
- [Task 1.3](task-1.3-docker-event-monitoring.md) - Docker Event Monitoring
- [Task 1.4](task-1.4-frontend-plugin-integration.md) - Frontend Plugin Integration

### Phase 2: Real-time Data Implementation

- [Task 2.1](task-2.1-container-status-updates.md) - Container Status Updates
- [Task 2.2](task-2.2-resource-monitoring.md) - Resource Monitoring
- [Task 2.3](task-2.3-system-event-broadcasting.md) - System Event Broadcasting

### Phase 3: User Experience and Optimization

- [Task 3.1](task-3.1-connection-state-management.md) - Connection State Management
- [Task 3.2](task-3.2-performance-optimization.md) - Performance Optimization
- [Task 3.3](task-3.3-fallback-error-handling.md) - Fallback and Error Handling

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

- [Task 4.1](task-4.1-testing-implementation.md) - Testing Implementation
- [Task 4.2](task-4.2-documentation-deployment.md) - Documentation and Deployment

## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path

1. **1.1** → **1.2** → **1.3** → **1.4** (Plugin integration must complete before backend/frontend)
2. **1.4** → **2.1** → **2.2** → **2.3** (Frontend integration must complete before real-time features)
3. **2.3** → **3.1** → **3.2** → **3.3** (Real-time features must work before UX optimization)

### Parallel Tasks

- **1.2** and **1.3** can be developed in parallel
- **2.1**, **2.2**, and **2.3** can be implemented simultaneously
- **3.1**, **3.2**, and **3.3** can be developed in parallel

### Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1**: 3-4 weeks (Plugin integration and backend setup)
- **Phase 2**: 4-5 weeks (Real-time implementation)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks (UX optimization)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks (Testing and documentation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 12-16 weeks

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Tauri WebSocket plugin successfully integrated
- [ ] WebSocket connection established on application startup
- [ ] Container status changes update in real-time
- [ ] Resource usage (CPU, Memory, Network) updates live
- [ ] System events broadcast immediately
- [ ] Connection state properly managed
- [ ] Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- [ ] Graceful fallback to polling when WebSocket unavailable

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Memory usage increase < 10MB for WebSocket overhead
- [ ] CPU usage increase < 5% for real-time processing
- [ ] Connection stability maintained during heavy operations
- [ ] No impact on existing polling-based functionality
- [ ] WebSocket connection latency < 100ms

### User Experience

- [ ] Visual indicator showing connection status
- [ ] Smooth transitions for status changes
- [ ] No UI freezing during updates
- [ ] Clear feedback when connection is lost
- [ ] Automatic recovery without user intervention

## Dependencies and Setup

### Required Packages

- `@tauri-apps/plugin-websocket` - Official Tauri WebSocket plugin
- `tokio-tungstenite` - Rust WebSocket implementation
- `docker-rs` - Docker API client for Rust

### Configuration Files

- `tauri.conf.json` - Plugin and capability configuration
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies
- `package.json` - Frontend dependencies

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Tauri WebSocket plugin successfully integrated and configured
- [ ] WebSocket server running in Rust backend
- [ ] Frontend WebSocket connection established and maintained
- [ ] Real-time container status updates working
- [ ] Resource usage live updates implemented
- [ ] Connection state properly managed with visual indicators
- [ ] Error handling and recovery implemented
- [ ] Fallback to polling mechanism working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

- **Primary focus**: Tauri WebSocket plugin integration
- **Fallback strategy**: Maintain existing polling as backup
- **Performance monitoring**: Track memory and CPU usage during development
- **Testing**: Test with large numbers of containers and high-frequency events
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication for WebSocket connections
- **Documentation**: Update developer docs with WebSocket usage examples
