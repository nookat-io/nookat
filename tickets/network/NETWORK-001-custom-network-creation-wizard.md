# [NETWORK-001] Create custom network creation wizard

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive custom network creation wizard that allows users to create and configure Docker networks with advanced settings and validation.

## Description

Users need to create custom Docker networks with specific configurations and settings. We need to implement a network creation wizard that provides step-by-step guidance, configuration validation, and advanced network settings management.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement custom network creation wizard interface
- Create step-by-step network configuration
- Add network settings validation and testing
- Implement network configuration templates
- Create network preview and simulation
- Add network creation help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement custom network creation logic
- Create network configuration validation
- Add network settings management
- Implement network testing and verification
- Create network configuration storage
- Add network creation analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User starts network creation wizard
2. Network configuration is entered step-by-step
3. Configuration is validated and tested
4. Network settings are applied and verified
5. Network is created and configured
6. Network creation results are reported
