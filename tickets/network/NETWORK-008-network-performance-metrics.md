# [NETWORK-008] Add network performance metrics

## Overview

Implement comprehensive network performance metrics that track and display network performance indicators, latency, throughput, and network health for Docker networks.

## Description

Users need to monitor network performance and track key metrics for their Docker networks. We need to implement network performance metrics that provide real-time performance monitoring, latency tracking, throughput analysis, and network health assessment.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement network performance metrics interface
- Create real-time performance monitoring
- Add latency and throughput visualization
- Implement network health assessment
- Create performance alerting and notifications
- Add performance reporting and analytics

### Backend

- Implement network performance monitoring
- Create performance metrics collection
- Add latency and throughput analysis
- Implement network health evaluation
- Create performance alerting system
- Add performance analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. Network performance data is collected in real-time
2. Performance metrics are calculated and analyzed
3. Latency and throughput are measured and tracked
4. Network health is assessed and evaluated
5. Performance alerts are triggered when needed
6. Performance reports and analytics are generated
