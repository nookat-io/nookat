# [NETWORK-007] Create container-to-container communication mapping

## Overview

Implement container-to-container communication mapping that visualizes and tracks communication patterns between containers in Docker networks.

## Description

Users need to understand and monitor communication patterns between containers in their Docker networks. We need to implement container communication mapping that provides visualization of container interactions, communication flow analysis, and network topology mapping.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement container communication mapping interface
- Create communication flow visualization
- Add container interaction tracking
- Implement network topology mapping
- Create communication pattern analysis
- Add communication filtering and search

### Backend

- Implement container communication monitoring
- Create communication flow analysis
- Add container interaction tracking
- Implement network topology generation
- Create communication pattern recognition
- Add communication analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. Container communication data is collected
2. Communication flows are analyzed and mapped
3. Container interactions are tracked and visualized
4. Network topology is generated and displayed
5. Communication patterns are identified
6. Communication analytics are reported
