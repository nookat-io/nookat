# [NETWORK-002] Implement network driver selection interface

## Overview

Implement a network driver selection interface that allows users to choose and configure different Docker network drivers with detailed information and recommendations.

## Description

Users need to select appropriate network drivers for their Docker networks based on requirements and use cases. We need to implement a network driver selection interface that provides driver information, recommendations, and configuration options.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement network driver selection interface
- Create driver information and comparison display
- Add driver recommendation system
- Implement driver configuration options
- Create driver testing and validation
- Add driver help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement network driver management
- Create driver information and capabilities
- Add driver recommendation engine
- Implement driver configuration validation
- Create driver testing and verification
- Add driver analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User accesses network driver selection interface
2. Available drivers are listed with information
3. Driver recommendations are provided based on requirements
4. Driver configuration options are displayed
5. Driver is tested and validated
6. Selected driver is configured and applied

## Acceptance Criteria
