# [NETWORK-003] Add subnet and gateway configuration

## Overview

Implement subnet and gateway configuration that allows users to configure network subnets, gateways, and IP address ranges for Docker networks with validation and conflict detection.

## Description

Users need to configure network subnets and gateways for their Docker networks. We need to implement subnet and gateway configuration that provides IP range management, conflict detection, and network address validation.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement subnet and gateway configuration interface
- Create IP range management and validation
- Add subnet conflict detection and resolution
- Implement gateway configuration and testing
- Create network address visualization
- Add configuration help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement subnet and gateway configuration logic
- Create IP range validation and management
- Add subnet conflict detection
- Implement gateway testing and verification
- Create network address analytics
- Add configuration storage and retrieval

### Data Flow

1. User configures subnet and gateway settings
2. IP ranges are validated and checked for conflicts
3. Gateway configuration is tested and verified
4. Network address space is analyzed
5. Configuration is applied and validated
6. Network configuration results are reported

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Subnet and gateway configuration interface
- [ ] IP range management and validation
- [ ] Subnet conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Gateway configuration and testing
- [ ] Network address visualization
- [ ] Configuration help and documentation
- [ ] Support for multiple IP address formats

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Configuration interface loads within 1 second
- [ ] IP validation completes within 500ms
