# [NETWORK-005] Add network connectivity testing

## Overview

Implement network connectivity testing that allows users to test network connections, diagnose connectivity issues, and validate network configurations.

## Description

Users need to test network connectivity and diagnose network issues in their Docker environments. We need to implement network connectivity testing that provides connection validation, diagnostic tools, and network troubleshooting capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement network connectivity testing interface
- Create connection testing and validation
- Add network diagnostic tools
- Implement connectivity reporting and visualization
- Create network troubleshooting guides
- Add connectivity testing automation

### Backend

- Implement network connectivity testing logic
- Create connection validation and testing
- Add network diagnostic capabilities
- Implement connectivity analytics and reporting
- Create network troubleshooting automation
- Add connectivity testing history and tracking

### Data Flow

1. User initiates network connectivity test
2. Connection tests are performed and validated
3. Network diagnostics are run and analyzed
4. Connectivity issues are identified and reported
5. Troubleshooting recommendations are provided
6. Test results are stored and tracked
