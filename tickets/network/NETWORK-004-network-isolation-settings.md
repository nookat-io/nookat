# [NETWORK-004] Implement network isolation settings

## Overview

Implement network isolation settings that allow users to configure network security, access controls, and isolation policies for Docker networks.

## Description

Users need to configure network isolation and security settings for their Docker networks. We need to implement network isolation settings that provide security policies, access controls, and network segmentation capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement network isolation settings interface
- Create security policy configuration
- Add access control management
- Implement network segmentation settings
- Create isolation policy templates
- Add isolation testing and validation

### Backend

- Implement network isolation logic
- Create security policy management
- Add access control enforcement
- Implement network segmentation
- Create isolation policy validation
- Add isolation analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User configures network isolation settings
2. Security policies are defined and validated
3. Access controls are configured and enforced
4. Network segmentation is applied
5. Isolation policies are tested and verified
6. Network isolation results are reported

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Network isolation settings interface
- [ ] Security policy configuration
- [ ] Access control management
- [ ] Network segmentation settings
- [ ] Isolation policy templates
- [ ] Isolation testing and validation
- [ ] Support for multiple isolation levels

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Isolation settings interface loads within 1 second
- [ ] Policy configuration saves within 500ms
- [ ] Access control validation completes within 1 second
- [ ] Isolation testing responds within 2 seconds
- [ ] Network isolation works across all platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive network isolation settings interface
- [ ] Clear security policy configuration
- [ ] Helpful access control management
- [ ] Professional network isolation workflow
- [ ] Seamless isolation policy setup

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Network isolation logic
// Security policy management
// Access control enforcement
// Network segmentation
// Isolation policy validation
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Network isolation settings interface
// Security policy configuration
// Access control management
// Network segmentation settings
// Isolation testing and validation
```

## Dependencies

- Network isolation library
- Security policy framework
- Access control management system
- Network segmentation utilities
- Policy validation framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Network isolation settings implemented
- [ ] Security policy configuration working
- [ ] Access control management functional
- [ ] Network segmentation settings operational
- [ ] Isolation policy templates
- [ ] Support for multiple isolation levels
- [ ] Tests written for network isolation settings
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing isolation policy presets
- Ensure isolation works with various network types
- Test isolation with different security scenarios
- Monitor isolation performance and optimize
