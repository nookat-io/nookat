# [NETWORK-006] Implement network traffic visualization

## Overview

Implement comprehensive network traffic visualization that displays real-time network traffic, bandwidth usage, and traffic patterns for Docker networks.

## Description

Users need to visualize network traffic and monitor bandwidth usage in their Docker networks. We need to implement network traffic visualization that provides real-time traffic monitoring, bandwidth analysis, and traffic pattern identification.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement network traffic visualization interface
- Create real-time traffic monitoring display
- Add bandwidth usage visualization
- Implement traffic pattern analysis
- Create traffic filtering and search
- Add traffic export and reporting

### Backend

- Implement network traffic monitoring
- Create traffic data collection and processing
- Add bandwidth usage analysis
- Implement traffic pattern recognition
- Create traffic analytics and reporting
- Add traffic data storage and retrieval

### Data Flow

1. Network traffic data is collected in real-time
2. Traffic data is processed and analyzed
3. Traffic patterns are identified and categorized
4. Bandwidth usage is calculated and visualized
5. Traffic data is filtered and displayed
6. Traffic reports and analytics are generated

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Network traffic visualization interface
- [ ] Real-time traffic monitoring display
- [ ] Bandwidth usage visualization
- [ ] Traffic pattern analysis
- [ ] Traffic filtering and search
- [ ] Traffic export and reporting
- [ ] Support for multiple network interfaces

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Traffic visualization loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Real-time updates occur within 1 second
- [ ] Traffic filtering responds within 500ms
