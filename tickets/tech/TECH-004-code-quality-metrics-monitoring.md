# [TECH-004] Add code quality metrics and monitoring

## Overview

Implement code quality metrics and monitoring to track code quality, maintainability, and technical debt across the codebase.

## Description

Users need to maintain high code quality and track technical debt. We need to implement code quality metrics and monitoring to provide comprehensive code quality tracking, maintainability analysis, and technical debt management.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement code quality metrics interface
- Create code quality dashboard and visualization
- Add code quality alerts and notifications
- Implement code quality reporting and export
- Create code quality configuration and management
- Add code quality trend analysis

### Backend

- Implement code quality metrics logic
- Create code quality analysis and calculation
- Add code quality monitoring and tracking
- Implement code quality alerts and notifications
- Create code quality analytics and reporting
- Add code quality configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Code quality metrics are calculated and analyzed
2. Code quality data is collected and processed
3. Code quality alerts are triggered
4. Code quality reports are generated
5. Code quality trends are analyzed
6. Code quality configuration is managed
