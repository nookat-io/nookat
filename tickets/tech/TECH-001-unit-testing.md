# [TECH-001] Implement unit testing

## Overview

Implement comprehensive unit testing framework to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability across the application.

## Description

Users need reliable and maintainable code. We need to implement unit testing to provide code quality assurance, bug prevention, and maintainable codebase.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement unit testing framework for React components
- Create test utilities and helpers
- Add component testing and validation
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Create test automation and CI integration
- Add test configuration and management

### Backend

- Implement unit testing framework for Rust backend
- Create test utilities and helpers
- Add service and handler testing
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Create test automation and CI integration
- Add test configuration management

### Data Flow

1. Unit tests are written and configured
2. Tests are executed automatically
3. Test results are collected and analyzed
4. Test coverage is reported
5. Test automation is integrated
6. Test configuration is managed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Unit testing framework for React components
- [ ] Unit testing framework for Rust backend
- [ ] Test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Component and service testing
- [ ] Test coverage reporting
- [ ] Test automation and CI integration
- [ ] Support for comprehensive testing

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests execute within 30 seconds
- [ ] Test coverage reports generate within 10 seconds
- [ ] Test automation responds within 1 minute
- [ ] Unit testing works across all platforms
- [ ] System handles test failures gracefully

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive unit testing framework
- [ ] Clear test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Helpful component and service testing
- [ ] Professional test coverage reporting
- [ ] Seamless test automation workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Unit testing framework for Rust backend
// Test utilities and helpers
// Service and handler testing
// Test coverage reporting
// Test automation and CI integration
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Unit testing framework for React components
// Test utilities and helpers
// Component testing and validation
// Test coverage reporting
// Test automation and CI integration
```

## Dependencies

- Unit testing frameworks (Jest, Rust test)
- Test coverage reporting tools
- Test automation framework
- CI/CD integration tools
- Test configuration management system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Unit testing framework implemented
- [ ] Test utilities and helpers working
- [ ] Component and service testing functional
- [ ] Test coverage reporting operational
- [ ] Support for comprehensive testing
- [ ] Tests written for unit testing framework
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing automated test generation
- Ensure unit testing works with various code patterns
- Test unit testing with different code scenarios
- Monitor unit testing performance and optimize
