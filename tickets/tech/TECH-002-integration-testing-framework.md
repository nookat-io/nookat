# [TECH-002] Add integration testing framework

## Overview

Implement integration testing framework to test component interactions, API integrations, and end-to-end workflows.

## Description

Users need reliable integration between components and services. We need to implement integration testing framework to provide comprehensive testing of component interactions, API integrations, and end-to-end workflows.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement integration testing framework for React
- Create API integration testing
- Add component interaction testing
- Implement end-to-end workflow testing
- Create integration test reporting
- Add integration test automation

### Backend

- Implement integration testing framework for Rust
- Create API integration testing
- Add service interaction testing
- Implement end-to-end workflow testing
- Create integration test reporting
- Add integration test automation

### Data Flow

1. Integration tests are written and configured
2. Component and service interactions are tested
3. API integrations are validated
4. End-to-end workflows are tested
5. Integration test results are reported
6. Integration test automation is executed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Integration testing framework for React
- [ ] Integration testing framework for Rust
- [ ] API integration testing
- [ ] Component and service interaction testing
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] Integration test reporting
- [ ] Support for comprehensive integration testing

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Integration tests execute within 2 minutes
- [ ] Integration test reports generate within 30 seconds
- [ ] Integration test automation responds within 3 minutes
- [ ] Integration testing works across all platforms
- [ ] System handles integration test failures gracefully

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive integration testing framework
- [ ] Clear API integration testing
- [ ] Helpful component and service interaction testing
- [ ] Professional end-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] Seamless integration test automation workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Integration testing framework for Rust
// API integration testing
// Service interaction testing
// End-to-end workflow testing
// Integration test reporting
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Integration testing framework for React
// API integration testing
// Component interaction testing
// End-to-end workflow testing
// Integration test reporting
```

## Dependencies

- Integration testing frameworks
- API testing utilities
- End-to-end testing tools
- Integration test reporting system
- Integration test automation framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Integration testing framework implemented
- [ ] API integration testing working
- [ ] Component and service interaction testing functional
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing operational
- [ ] Support for comprehensive integration testing
- [ ] Tests written for integration testing framework
