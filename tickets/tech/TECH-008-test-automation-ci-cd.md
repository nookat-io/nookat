# [TECH-008] Implement test automation and CI/CD integration

## Overview

Implement comprehensive test automation and CI/CD integration to ensure all tests run automatically, provide quality gates, and prevent broken code from reaching production.

## Description

The testing infrastructure needs to be fully automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. We need to implement pre-commit hooks, automated test execution, quality gates, and deployment blocking mechanisms.

## Technical Requirements

### Pre-commit Hooks Setup

- Implement Husky for Git hooks management
- Configure lint-staged for staged file processing
- Add pre-commit validation for code quality
- Implement commit message validation
- Add branch protection rules
- Create automated code formatting

### CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement

- Implement GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- Create multi-stage validation pipeline
- Add parallel test execution
- Implement test result reporting and notifications
- Add performance benchmarking
- Create automated deployment validation

### Quality Gates Implementation

- Set minimum test coverage thresholds
- Implement performance benchmarks
- Add security vulnerability scanning
- Create code quality metrics
- Implement automated code review
- Add dependency vulnerability checks

### Test Environment Management

- Create isolated test environments
- Implement test data management
- Add environment-specific configurations
- Create test cleanup mechanisms
- Implement test isolation
- Add test resource management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Pre-commit hooks preventing low-quality commits
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Quality gates blocking deployments
- [ ] Test result reporting and notifications
- [ ] Automated code formatting and linting
- [ ] Test environment isolation and management
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Pre-commit hooks execute within 10 seconds
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline completes within 15 minutes
- [ ] Test notifications sent within 1 minute
- [ ] Quality gate evaluation within 2 minutes
- [ ] Test environment setup within 3 minutes

### Quality Requirements

- [ ] 80%+ test coverage required for deployment
- [ ] Zero linting errors allowed
- [ ] All tests must pass before deployment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks must meet thresholds
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities must be resolved

## Technical Implementation

### Husky Configuration

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts,.tsx --max-warnings=0",
    "lint:fix": "eslint src --ext .ts,.tsx --fix",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,css,md}\"",
    "format:check": "prettier --check \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,css,md}\"",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "husky": "^8.0.0",
    "lint-staged": "^15.0.0",
    "prettier": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.{json,css,md}": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

### Husky Hooks

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .husky/pre-commit
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npm run lint:fix

```

## Dependencies

- Husky for Git hooks
- lint-staged for staged file processing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Codecov for coverage reporting
- Trivy for security scanning
- Prettier for code formatting

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Pre-commit hooks preventing low-quality commits
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with quality gates operational
- [ ] Automated test execution working
- [ ] Quality gates blocking deployments
- [ ] Test result reporting and notifications
- [ ] Security scanning integrated
- [ ] Documentation and team training completed

## Notes

- Start with basic pre-commit hooks and gradually add complexity
- Implement quality gates incrementally to avoid blocking development
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance and optimize slow stages
- Establish clear quality thresholds based on team consensus
- Consider implementing automated code review tools
