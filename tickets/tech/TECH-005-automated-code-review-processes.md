# [TECH-005] Implement automated code review processes

## Overview

Implement automated code review processes to ensure code quality, consistency, and adherence to coding standards.

## Description

Users need consistent code quality and adherence to standards. We need to implement automated code review processes to provide automated code analysis, consistency checking, and quality assurance.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement automated code review interface
- Create code review automation and workflows
- Add code review rules and standards
- Implement code review reporting and analytics
- Create code review configuration and management
- Add code review integration with CI/CD

### Backend

- Implement automated code review logic
- Create code review automation and workflows
