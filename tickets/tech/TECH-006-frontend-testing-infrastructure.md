# [TECH-006] Implement frontend testing infrastructure

## Overview

Implement comprehensive frontend testing infrastructure including Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright, and visual regression testing to ensure UI stability and prevent regressions.

## Description

The frontend needs a robust testing infrastructure to catch bugs early and ensure feature stability. We need to implement Jest + React Testing Library for unit testing, Playwright for end-to-end testing, and visual regression testing for UI consistency.

## Technical Requirements

### Unit Testing Setup

- Implement Jest as the primary testing framework
- Configure React Testing Library for component testing
- Set up test utilities and custom render functions
- Create test coverage reporting with thresholds
- Implement test data factories and fixtures
- Add component testing patterns and best practices

### Integration Testing Setup

- Implement Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Create test scenarios for critical user workflows
- Set up test environment with Docker containers
- Implement test data setup and teardown
- Add visual comparison testing
- Create cross-browser testing capabilities

### Visual Regression Testing

- Implement Chromatic or Percy for visual testing
- Set up baseline image management
- Create visual diff reporting
- Implement automated visual testing in CI/CD
- Add responsive design testing
- Create visual testing for different themes

### Test Automation

- Set up test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- Implement parallel test execution
- Create test result reporting and notifications
- Add test performance monitoring
- Implement test retry mechanisms for flaky tests
- Create test environment management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Jest testing framework fully configured
- [ ] React Testing Library integration working
- [ ] Playwright E2E testing operational
- [ ] Visual regression testing functional
- [ ] Test coverage reporting with 80%+ target
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD
- [ ] Cross-browser testing capabilities

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests execute within 30 seconds
- [ ] E2E tests complete within 5 minutes
- [ ] Visual tests complete within 2 minutes
- [ ] Test coverage reports generate within 10 seconds
- [ ] CI/CD test stage completes within 8 minutes

### Quality Requirements

- [ ] 80%+ test coverage for critical components
- [ ] Zero flaky tests in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] All critical user workflows covered by E2E tests
- [ ] Visual regressions detected automatically
- [ ] Test failures block deployments

## Technical Implementation

### Jest Configuration

```typescript
// jest.config.ts
export default {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/test/setup.ts'],
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
    '!src/main.tsx',
    '!src/vite-env.d.ts',
  ],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80,
    },
  },
};
```

### React Testing Library Setup

```typescript
// src/test/test-utils.tsx
import { render, RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@/contexts/theme-context'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

const AllTheProviders = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <BrowserRouter>
        {children}
      </BrowserRouter>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

const customRender = (
  ui: React.ReactElement,
  options?: Omit<RenderOptions, 'wrapper'>
) => render(ui, { wrapper: AllTheProviders, ...options })

export * from '@testing-library/react'
export { customRender as render }
```

### Playwright Configuration

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: 'html',
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:1420',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    },
  ],
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run tauri dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:1420',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

## Dependencies

- Jest testing framework
- React Testing Library
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Chromatic or Percy for visual testing
- Test coverage reporting tools
- CI/CD integration tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Jest testing framework fully operational
- [ ] React Testing Library integration complete
- [ ] Playwright E2E testing working
- [ ] Visual regression testing functional
