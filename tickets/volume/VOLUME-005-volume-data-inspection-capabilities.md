# [VOLUME-005] Add volume data inspection capabilities

## Overview

Implement volume data inspection capabilities that allow users to browse, search, and analyze data within Docker volumes with file system navigation and content preview.

## Description

Users need to inspect and analyze data within Docker volumes to understand their contents and structure. We need to implement volume data inspection capabilities that provide file system navigation, content preview, and data analysis tools.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement volume data inspection interface
- Create file system browser and navigation
- Add content preview and search capabilities
- Implement data analysis and reporting
- Create volume data filtering and organization
- Add data inspection help and documentation

### Backend

- Implement volume data inspection logic
- Create file system navigation and browsing
- Add content preview and search
- Implement data analysis and reporting
- Create volume data filtering and organization
- Add data inspection analytics and storage

### Data Flow

1. User selects volume for data inspection
2. File system structure is analyzed and displayed
3. Content is previewed and searched
4. Data analysis is performed and reported
5. Volume data is filtered and organized
6. Inspection results are stored and tracked

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Volume data inspection interface
- [ ] File system browser and navigation
- [ ] Content preview and search capabilities
- [ ] Data analysis and reporting
- [ ] Volume data filtering and organization
- [ ] Data inspection help and documentation
