# [VOLUME-003] Create volume size analysis

## Overview

Implement comprehensive volume size analysis that provides detailed insights into volume usage, space allocation, and storage optimization recommendations.

## Description

Users need to analyze volume sizes and understand storage usage patterns in their Docker environments. We need to implement volume size analysis that provides detailed insights, usage patterns, and storage optimization recommendations.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement volume size analysis interface
- Create volume usage visualization and reporting
- Add storage space allocation analysis
- Implement size trend analysis and forecasting
- Create storage optimization recommendations
- Add volume size comparison and benchmarking

### Backend

- Implement volume size analysis logic
- Create volume usage data collection
- Add storage space allocation analysis
- Implement size trend analysis and forecasting
- Create storage optimization recommendations
- Add volume size analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. Volume size data is collected and analyzed
2. Usage patterns are identified and categorized
3. Storage space allocation is calculated
4. Size trends are analyzed and forecasted
5. Optimization recommendations are generated
6. Size analysis results are reported and visualized
