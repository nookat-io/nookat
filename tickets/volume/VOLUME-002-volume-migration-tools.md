# [VOLUME-002] Add volume migration tools

## Overview

Implement volume migration tools that allow users to migrate Docker volumes between different storage backends, systems, and environments with validation and rollback capabilities.

## Description

Users need to migrate Docker volumes between different storage systems and environments. We need to implement volume migration tools that provide safe migration processes, validation, and rollback capabilities for data integrity.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement volume migration tools interface
- Create migration wizard and configuration
- Add migration validation and testing
- Implement migration progress tracking
- Create migration rollback capabilities
- Add migration history and reporting

### Backend

- Implement volume migration logic
- Create migration validation and testing
- Add migration progress tracking
- Implement migration rollback system
- Create migration analytics and reporting
- Add migration configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User configures volume migration settings
2. Migration is validated and tested
3. Migration process is executed with progress tracking
4. Migration is validated and verified
5. Rollback is available if needed
6. Migration results are reported and stored

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Volume migration tools interface
- [ ] Migration wizard and configuration
- [ ] Migration validation and testing
- [ ] Migration progress tracking
- [ ] Migration rollback capabilities
- [ ] Migration history and reporting
- [ ] Support for multiple migration targets

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Migration tools interface loads within 1 second
- [ ] Migration validation completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Migration progress updates within 500ms
- [ ] Migration tools work with large volumes
- [ ] Volume migration tools work across all platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive volume migration tools interface
- [ ] Clear migration wizard and configuration
- [ ] Helpful migration validation and testing
- [ ] Professional migration management workflow
- [ ] Seamless migration process with rollback

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Volume migration logic
// Migration validation and testing
// Migration progress tracking
// Migration rollback system
// Migration analytics and reporting
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Volume migration tools interface
// Migration wizard and configuration
// Migration validation and testing
// Migration progress tracking
// Migration rollback capabilities
```

## Dependencies

- Volume migration library
- Migration validation framework
- Progress tracking utilities
- Rollback system framework
- Migration analytics and reporting tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Volume migration tools implemented
- [ ] Migration wizard and configuration working
- [ ] Migration validation and testing functional
- [ ] Migration progress tracking operational
- [ ] Migration rollback capabilities
- [ ] Support for multiple migration targets
- [ ] Tests written for volume migration tools
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing incremental migration support
- Ensure migration works with various storage backends
- Test migration with large data volumes
- Monitor migration performance and optimize
