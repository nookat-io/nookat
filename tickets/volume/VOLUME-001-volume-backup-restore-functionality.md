# [VOLUME-001] Implement volume backup and restore functionality

## Overview

Implement comprehensive volume backup and restore functionality that allows users to backup Docker volumes, restore them, and manage backup versions with scheduling and automation.

## Description

Users need to backup and restore Docker volumes to protect their data and enable disaster recovery. We need to implement volume backup and restore functionality that provides automated backups, version management, and reliable restore capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement volume backup and restore interface
- Create backup scheduling and automation
- Add backup version management and history
- Implement restore wizard and validation
- Create backup monitoring and status tracking
- Add backup configuration and settings

### Backend

- Implement volume backup and restore logic
- Create backup scheduling and automation
- Add backup version management
- Implement restore validation and testing
- Create backup monitoring and analytics
- Add backup configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User configures volume backup settings
2. Backup is scheduled and executed automatically
3. Backup versions are managed and stored
4. Restore process is validated and tested
5. Backup status is monitored and reported
6. Backup analytics and history are maintained

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Volume backup and restore interface
- [ ] Backup scheduling and automation
- [ ] Backup version management and history
- [ ] Restore wizard and validation
- [ ] Backup monitoring and status tracking
- [ ] Backup configuration and settings
- [ ] Support for multiple backup formats

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Backup interface loads within 1 second
- [ ] Backup scheduling responds within 500ms
- [ ] Restore validation completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Backup operations work with large volumes
- [ ] Volume backup and restore works across all platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive volume backup and restore interface
- [ ] Clear backup scheduling and automation
- [ ] Helpful restore wizard and validation
- [ ] Professional backup management workflow
- [ ] Seamless backup and restore process

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Volume backup and restore logic
