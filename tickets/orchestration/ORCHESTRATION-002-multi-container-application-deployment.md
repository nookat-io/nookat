# [ORCHESTRATION-002] Add multi-container application deployment

## Overview

Implement multi-container application deployment system that allows users to deploy complex applications with multiple containers, dependencies, and configuration management.

## Description

Users need to deploy multi-container applications with proper dependency management and configuration. We need to implement a deployment system that handles multi-container applications, manages dependencies, and provides deployment monitoring and rollback capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement multi-container deployment interface
- Create deployment configuration and management
- Add deployment monitoring and status tracking
- Implement deployment rollback and recovery
- Create deployment history and logging
- Add deployment templates and presets

### Backend

- Implement multi-container deployment orchestration
- Create deployment dependency management
- Add deployment configuration management
- Implement deployment monitoring and tracking
- Create deployment rollback system
- Add deployment history and analytics

### Data Flow

1. User configures multi-container deployment
2. Deployment dependencies are validated
3. Containers are deployed in correct order
4. Deployment status is monitored in real-time
5. Deployment rollback is available if needed
6. Deployment history is tracked and logged

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Multi-container deployment interface
- [ ] Deployment configuration and management
- [ ] Deployment monitoring and status tracking
- [ ] Deployment rollback and recovery
- [ ] Deployment history and logging
- [ ] Deployment templates and presets
- [ ] Dependency management and validation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Deployment configuration saves within 500ms
- [ ] Deployment starts within 2 seconds
- [ ] Deployment status updates within 1 second
- [ ] Rollback completes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Deployment system works with complex applications

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive multi-container deployment interface
- [ ] Clear deployment configuration and status
- [ ] Helpful deployment monitoring
- [ ] Professional deployment management
- [ ] Seamless deployment orchestration

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Multi-container deployment orchestration
// Deployment dependency management
// Configuration management
// Monitoring and tracking
// Rollback system
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Multi-container deployment interface
// Configuration and management
// Monitoring and status tracking
// Rollback and recovery
// History and logging
```

## Dependencies

- Multi-container orchestration library
- Deployment dependency framework
- Configuration management system
- Monitoring and tracking utilities
- Rollback and recovery framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Multi-container deployment implemented
- [ ] Deployment configuration working
- [ ] Deployment monitoring functional
- [ ] Deployment rollback operational
- [ ] Deployment history and logging
- [ ] Deployment templates and presets
- [ ] Tests written for multi-container deployment
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing deployment blueprints
- Ensure deployment works with various application types
- Test deployment with complex dependency scenarios
- Monitor deployment performance and optimize
