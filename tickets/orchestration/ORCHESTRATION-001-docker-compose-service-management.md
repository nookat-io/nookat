# [ORCHESTRATION-001] Implement Docker Compose service management

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Docker Compose service management that allows users to create, configure, deploy, and manage multi-container applications using Docker Compose.

## Description

Users need to manage multi-container applications using Docker Compose. We need to implement a Docker Compose service management system that provides GUI-based creation, configuration, deployment, and management of Compose services with real-time status monitoring.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement Docker Compose service management interface
- Create Compose file editor with syntax highlighting
- Add service configuration and management
- Implement service deployment and lifecycle management
- Create service status monitoring and visualization
- Add Compose project management and organization

### Backend

- Implement Docker Compose service operations
- Create Compose file parsing and validation
- Add service deployment and orchestration
- Implement service status monitoring
- Create Compose project management
- Add service configuration management

### Data Flow

1. User creates or loads Docker Compose configuration
2. Compose file is parsed and validated
3. Services are deployed and orchestrated
4. Service status is monitored in real-time
5. Service lifecycle operations are managed
6. Compose projects are organized and tracked

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Docker Compose service management interface
- [ ] Compose file editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Service configuration and management
- [ ] Service deployment and lifecycle management
- [ ] Service status monitoring and visualization
- [ ] Compose project management and organization
- [ ] Compose file validation and error handling

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Compose file parsing completes within 1 second
- [ ] Service deployment starts within 2 seconds
- [ ] Service status updates within 500ms
- [ ] Compose operations work with large projects
- [ ] Compose management works across all platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive Compose service management interface
- [ ] Clear service configuration and status
- [ ] Helpful Compose file editing experience
- [ ] Professional service management appearance
- [ ] Seamless multi-container orchestration

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Docker Compose service operations
// Compose file parsing and validation
// Service deployment and orchestration
// Service status monitoring
// Project management
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Docker Compose service management interface
// Compose file editor
// Service configuration and management
// Status monitoring and visualization
// Project management
```

## Dependencies

- Docker Compose library
- Compose file parsing framework
- Service orchestration utilities
- Status monitoring system
- Project management framework

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Docker Compose service management implemented
- [ ] Compose file editor working
- [ ] Service configuration and management functional
- [ ] Service deployment and lifecycle management
- [ ] Service status monitoring operational
- [ ] Compose project management
- [ ] Tests written for Compose service management
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing Compose file templates
- Ensure Compose management works with complex configurations
- Test Compose operations with various service types
- Monitor Compose performance and optimize
