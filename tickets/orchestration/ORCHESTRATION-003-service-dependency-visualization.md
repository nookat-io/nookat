# [ORCHESTRATION-003] Create service dependency visualization

## Overview

Implement service dependency visualization that displays the relationships and dependencies between containers and services in a visual, interactive format.

## Description

Users need to understand the relationships and dependencies between containers and services in their applications. We need to implement a service dependency visualization system that displays these relationships in an interactive, visual format with real-time updates.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement service dependency visualization interface
- Create interactive dependency graph display
- Add dependency relationship management
- Implement real-time dependency updates
- Create dependency analysis and insights
- Add dependency export and reporting

### Backend

- Implement service dependency analysis
- Create dependency graph generation
- Add dependency relationship tracking
- Implement dependency change detection
- Create dependency analytics and reporting
- Add dependency storage and retrieval

### Data Flow

1. Service dependencies are analyzed and mapped
2. Dependency graph is generated and visualized
3. Real-time dependency changes are detected
4. Dependency relationships are updated
5. Dependency insights and analytics are generated
6. Users can interact with and export dependency data
