# [ENGINE-002] Add Docker Engine installation automation

## Overview

Implement automated Docker Engine installation capabilities to help users set up Docker when it's not available, providing a seamless onboarding experience.

## Description

When Docker Engine is not detected, users currently need to manually install Docker themselves. We need to implement automated installation capabilities that can guide users through Docker Engine installation or automatically install Docker when possible, reducing friction for new users.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement Docker Engine installation wizard
- Create installation progress tracking and feedback
- Add platform-specific installation guidance
- Implement installation verification and testing
- Create installation troubleshooting and support
- Add installation status persistence and recovery

### Backend

- Implement platform-specific installation scripts
- Create Docker Engine installation automation
- Add installation verification and validation
- Implement installation progress monitoring
- Create installation rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Add installation analytics and error reporting

### Data Flow

1. User initiates Docker Engine installation
2. Platform detection determines installation method
3. Installation script downloads and installs Docker
4. Progress is monitored and reported to frontend
5. Installation is verified and tested
6. User receives confirmation and next steps

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Automated Docker Engine installation for supported platforms
- [ ] Platform-specific installation guidance and scripts
- [ ] Installation progress tracking and feedback
- [ ] Installation verification and testing
- [ ] Installation troubleshooting and support
- [ ] Installation rollback and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Installation status persistence and recovery

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Installation completes within 5 minutes for most platforms
- [ ] Installation doesn't require elevated privileges when possible
- [ ] Installation verification completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Installation rollback works reliably
- [ ] Installation supports offline scenarios with guidance

### User Experience

- [ ] Clear installation progress and feedback
- [ ] Helpful installation guidance and troubleshooting
- [ ] Seamless installation experience
- [ ] Professional installation interface
- [ ] Clear post-installation next steps

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Platform-specific installation scripts
// Installation automation
// Progress monitoring
// Verification and validation
// Rollback and recovery
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Installation wizard
// Progress tracking
// Platform-specific guidance
// Verification and testing
// Troubleshooting support
```

## Dependencies

- Platform-specific installation scripts
- Installation automation framework
- Progress monitoring system
- Verification and testing tools
- Rollback and recovery utilities

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Automated Docker Engine installation implemented
- [ ] Platform-specific installation working
- [ ] Installation progress tracking functional
- [ ] Installation verification and testing
- [ ] Installation troubleshooting available
- [ ] Installation rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Tests written for installation system

## Notes

- Consider implementing silent installation options
- Ensure installation works with various system configurations
- Test installation with different user permission levels
- Monitor installation success rates and optimize
