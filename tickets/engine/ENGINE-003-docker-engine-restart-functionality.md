# [ENGINE-003] Implement Docker Engine restart functionality

## Overview

Implement Docker Engine restart capabilities to allow users to restart the Docker daemon when needed, with proper safety checks and status monitoring.

## Description

Users currently need to manually restart Docker Engine through system commands when issues arise. We need to implement safe Docker Engine restart functionality that can restart the Docker daemon with proper validation, safety checks, and status monitoring to ensure a smooth restart process.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement Docker Engine restart interface
- Create restart progress tracking and feedback
- Add restart safety checks and confirmations
- Implement restart status monitoring
- Create restart troubleshooting and recovery
- Add restart history and logging

### Backend

- Implement safe Docker Engine restart mechanisms
- Create restart safety checks and validation
- Add restart progress monitoring and reporting
- Implement restart verification and testing
- Create restart rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Add restart analytics and error reporting

### Data Flow

1. User initiates Docker Engine restart
2. Safety checks validate restart conditions
3. Docker daemon is safely stopped
4. Docker daemon is restarted with monitoring
5. Restart is verified and tested
6. User receives confirmation and status

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Safe Docker Engine restart functionality
- [ ] Restart safety checks and validations
- [ ] Restart progress tracking and feedback
- [ ] Restart verification and testing
- [ ] Restart troubleshooting and recovery
- [ ] Restart history and logging
- [ ] Restart rollback mechanisms

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Restart completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Restart doesn't impact running containers unnecessarily
- [ ] Restart verification completes within 10 seconds
- [ ] Restart rollback works reliably
- [ ] Restart monitoring uses minimal system resources

### User Experience

- [ ] Clear restart progress and feedback
- [ ] Helpful restart guidance and safety warnings
- [ ] Seamless restart experience
- [ ] Professional restart interface
- [ ] Clear post-restart status and next steps

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Safe Docker Engine restart
// Safety checks and validation
// Progress monitoring
// Verification and testing
// Rollback and recovery
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Restart interface
// Progress tracking
// Safety checks and confirmations
// Status monitoring
// Troubleshooting support
```

## Dependencies

- Docker Engine restart utilities
- Safety check and validation framework
- Progress monitoring system
- Verification and testing tools
- Rollback and recovery utilities

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Safe Docker Engine restart implemented
- [ ] Restart safety checks functional
- [ ] Restart progress tracking working
- [ ] Restart verification and testing
- [ ] Restart troubleshooting available
- [ ] Restart rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Tests written for restart system
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing scheduled restart capabilities
- Ensure restart doesn't interfere with critical operations
- Test restart with various Docker configurations
- Monitor restart success rates and optimize
