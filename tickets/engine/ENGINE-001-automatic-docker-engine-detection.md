# [ENGINE-001] Implement automatic Docker Engine detection

## Overview

Implement automatic detection of Docker Engine installation and status to provide seamless user experience and clear feedback about Docker availability.

## Description

Currently, the application assumes Docker Engine is available without proper detection mechanisms. We need to implement comprehensive Docker Engine detection that can identify if Docker is installed, running, accessible, and properly configured, providing clear feedback to users about the current state.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement Docker Engine status detection and display
- Create real-time Docker Engine health monitoring
- Add Docker Engine status indicators and notifications
- Implement Docker Engine connection testing
- Create Docker Engine troubleshooting guidance
- Add Docker Engine status persistence and caching

### Backend

- Implement Docker Engine detection algorithms
- Create Docker daemon connection testing
- Add Docker Engine version and capability detection
- Implement Docker Engine health check endpoints
- Create Docker Engine status reporting and analytics
- Add Docker Engine configuration validation

### Data Flow

1. Application starts and attempts Docker Engine detection
2. Backend tests Docker daemon connectivity
3. Docker Engine version and capabilities are detected
4. Status is reported to frontend with detailed information
5. Real-time monitoring continues for status changes
6. User receives clear feedback about Docker Engine state

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Automatic detection of Docker Engine installation
- [ ] Real-time Docker Engine status monitoring
- [ ] Docker Engine version and capability detection
- [ ] Clear status indicators and notifications
- [ ] Docker Engine connection testing
- [ ] Troubleshooting guidance for common issues
- [ ] Docker Engine status persistence across sessions

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Docker Engine detection completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Real-time status updates within 500ms
- [ ] Detection doesn't impact application startup time
- [ ] Status monitoring uses minimal system resources
- [ ] Detection works across all supported platforms

### User Experience

- [ ] Clear indication of Docker Engine status
- [ ] Helpful troubleshooting guidance when Docker is unavailable
- [ ] Seamless experience when Docker is properly configured
- [ ] Professional status presentation and feedback
- [ ] No confusion about Docker Engine availability

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
