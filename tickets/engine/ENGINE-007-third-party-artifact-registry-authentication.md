# [ENGINE-007] Add third-party artifact registry authentication

## Overview

Implement authentication management for third-party artifact registries (AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR, etc.) to enable users to access private repositories across multiple cloud platforms.

## Description

Users need to authenticate with various third-party artifact registries to access private repositories and images. Currently, this requires manual configuration for each registry. We need to implement a unified authentication system that supports multiple registry types and provides a consistent user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement multi-registry authentication interface
- Create registry-specific authentication flows
- Add authentication status monitoring for all registries
- Implement authentication testing and validation
- Create authentication history and management
- Add registry-specific documentation and help

### Backend

- Implement multi-registry authentication management
- Create registry-specific authentication adapters
- Add authentication credential encryption and storage
- Implement authentication token management and refresh
- Create authentication monitoring and health checks
- Add authentication analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User configures authentication for specific registry
2. Registry-specific authentication flow is initiated
3. Credentials are securely stored and encrypted
4. Authentication is tested and validated
5. Authentication status is monitored across registries
6. User receives unified authentication status and feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Multi-registry authentication interface
- [ ] Support for AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR
- [ ] Registry-specific authentication flows
- [ ] Authentication testing and validation
- [ ] Authentication status monitoring
- [ ] Authentication token management
- [ ] Authentication history and logging

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Authentication interface loads within 1 second
- [ ] Authentication testing completes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Credentials are properly encrypted and secured
- [ ] Authentication monitoring uses minimal resources
- [ ] Authentication supports at least 5 registry types

### User Experience

- [ ] Unified authentication interface for all registries
- [ ] Clear authentication status and feedback
- [ ] Registry-specific authentication guidance
- [ ] Professional authentication management
- [ ] Safe credential handling and storage

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Multi-registry authentication management
// Registry-specific authentication adapters
// Credential encryption and storage
// Token management and refresh
// Monitoring and health checks
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Multi-registry authentication interface
// Registry-specific authentication flows
// Status monitoring and display
// Testing and validation
// Documentation and help
```

## Dependencies

- Multi-registry authentication library
- Registry-specific authentication adapters
- Credential encryption framework
- Token management system
- Monitoring and health check tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Multi-registry authentication management implemented
- [ ] Support for AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR
- [ ] Registry-specific authentication flows
- [ ] Authentication testing and validation
- [ ] Authentication status monitoring
- [ ] Authentication token management
- [ ] Tests written for multi-registry authentication
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing OAuth2 flows for cloud registries
- Ensure credentials are never exposed in logs
- Test authentication with various registry configurations
- Monitor authentication success rates across registries
