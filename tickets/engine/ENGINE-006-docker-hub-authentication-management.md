# [ENGINE-006] Implement Docker Hub authentication management

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Docker Hub authentication management that allows users to securely configure and manage Docker Hub credentials for accessing private repositories and rate-limited resources.

## Description

Users need to authenticate with Docker Hub to access private repositories and avoid rate limiting. Currently, this requires manual configuration. We need to implement a secure authentication management system that handles Docker Hub credentials safely and provides a user-friendly interface for authentication management.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Implement Docker Hub authentication interface
- Create secure credential input and management
- Add authentication status monitoring and display
- Implement authentication testing and validation
- Create authentication history and logging
- Add authentication troubleshooting and support

### Backend

- Implement secure Docker Hub authentication storage
- Create authentication credential encryption
- Add authentication testing and validation
- Implement authentication token management
- Create authentication monitoring and health checks
- Add authentication analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

1. User configures Docker Hub authentication
2. Credentials are securely stored and encrypted
3. Authentication is tested and validated
4. Authentication status is monitored
5. Authentication tokens are managed and refreshed
6. User receives authentication status and feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Secure Docker Hub authentication interface
- [ ] Credential encryption and secure storage
- [ ] Authentication testing and validation
- [ ] Authentication status monitoring
- [ ] Authentication token management
- [ ] Authentication history and logging
- [ ] Authentication troubleshooting and support

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Authentication interface loads within 500ms
- [ ] Authentication testing completes within 3 seconds
- [ ] Credentials are properly encrypted and secured
- [ ] Authentication monitoring uses minimal resources
- [ ] Authentication supports various credential types

### User Experience

- [ ] Secure and intuitive authentication interface
- [ ] Clear authentication status and feedback
- [ ] Helpful authentication troubleshooting
- [ ] Professional authentication management
- [ ] Safe credential handling and storage

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

```rust
// Docker Hub authentication management
// Credential encryption and storage
// Authentication testing and validation
// Token management
// Monitoring and health checks
```

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Authentication interface
// Secure credential input
// Status monitoring and display
// Testing and validation
// Troubleshooting support
```

## Dependencies

- Docker Hub authentication library
- Credential encryption framework
- Authentication testing utilities
- Token management system
- Monitoring and health check tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Docker Hub authentication management implemented
- [ ] Credential encryption and secure storage
- [ ] Authentication testing and validation
- [ ] Authentication status monitoring
- [ ] Authentication token management
- [ ] Authentication history and logging
- [ ] Tests written for authentication system
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Consider implementing OAuth2 authentication flow
- Ensure credentials are never exposed in logs
- Test authentication with various Docker Hub configurations
- Monitor authentication success rates and token refresh
